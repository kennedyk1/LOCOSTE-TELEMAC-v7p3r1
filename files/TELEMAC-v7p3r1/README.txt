TELEMAC-MASCARET is an integrated suite of solvers for use in the field of
free-surface flow. Having been used in the context of many studies throughout
the world, it has become one of the major standards in its field.
TELEMAC-MASCARET is managed by a consortium of core organisations: Artelia
(France), BundesAnstalt für Wasserbau (BAW, Germany), Centre
d’Etudes Techniques Maritimes et Fluviales (CETMEF, France), Daresbury
Laboratory (United Kingdom), Electricité de France R&D (EDF, France), and HR
Wallingford (United Kingdom).

TELEMAC-MASCARET is used by most partners for dimensioning and impact studies,
where safety is prevailing and, for this reason, reliability, validation and a
worldwide recognition of our tools are of utmost importance. As a consequence
and to improve the access to TELEMAC-MASCARET for the whole community of
consultants and researchers, the choice of open source has been made. Anyone
can thus take advantage of TELEMAC-MASCARET and assess its performances, and
will find necessary resources on this website. However the quality of
assistance, maintenance and hotline support are also very important to
 professional users, and a special effort has been made to offer alternatively a
broad range of fee-paying services.
