This is an EXAMPLE for the usage of the

Continuous Vertical Grain Sorting
for Telemac & Sisyphe v6p3


- Selafin files are Big Endian
- Designed for v6p1, tested with v6p2r1_SVN:2372

- Run with telemac2d -t tel.cas
- Results are in the normal Telemac + Sisyphe result files AND in the _tmp folder:  
   1. VSPRES = SELAFIN3D of the Vertical Sorting Profile
   2. VSPHYD = SELFIN3D version of the T2DRES file
   3. the temporary folder contains detailed information for single points, if chosen in the sis.cas files
   
- This example is academic only  and not meant to reproduce Astrid Bloms flume results with the here delivered parameter set.
