% - Purpose & Description:
%     These first two parts give reader short details about the test case,
%     the physical phenomena involved, the geometry and specify how the numerical solution will be validated
%
\section{Purpose}
%
This test illustrates that \telemac{3d} is able to simulate a real dam
break flow on an initially dry domain.
It also shows the propagation of the wave front and the evolution in
time of the water surface and velocities in the valley downstream.
%
\section{Description}
%
This case is the simulation of the propagation of the wave following
the break of the Malpasset dam (South-East of France).
Such accident really occurred in December 1959.
The model represents the reservoir upstream from the dam and the valley
and flood plain downstream.
The entire valley is approximately 18~km long and between 200~m (valley)
and 7~km wide (flood plain).
The complete study is described in details in [1].
The simulation is performed using 2 or 6 vertical planes ("pos\_p2" and
"pos\_p6") using the treatment of negative depths introduced since
\telemac{3d} 7.0.
The historical simulation using 2 vertical planes and the method of
characteristics (named "charac\_p2") has been kept.
Nevertheless, the recommended advection scheme for velocities for such
applications is now the N-type MURD scheme (14).
A simulation using 2 vertical planes with a large mesh (named
"large") is also performed.

\section{Results}
%
Figure ??? illustrates the progression of the flood wave after the dam
break (simulation using the treatment of negative depths that smoothes
the results on tidal flats).
The propagation of the wave front is very fast.
The water depths increase rapidly in the valley downstream from the dam
location.
The wave spreads in the plain when arriving to the sea.
During the simulation, no negative water depths are observed.
Figure ??? presents the water depth at time = 400~s obtained with 2
planes (p2), 6 planes (p6) and the treatment of negative depths,
2 planes using the method of characteristics (charac)
and 2 planes using the fine mesh (p2\_large) calculations.
The results are similar.
%However, the time profiles concerning the point located as indicated by
%squares in the upper panels of the figure, show that the "pos"
%planes simulation slightly underestimate the maximum water elevation.
%
\section{Conclusion}
%
\telemac{3d} is capable of simulating the propagation of a dam break
wave in a river valley initially dry.
