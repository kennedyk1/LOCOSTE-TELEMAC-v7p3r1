Release V7P3R1 (  /  /18)
===========================
Bug fixes
---------------------

- Fix in HERMES: Error in check of argument of get_mesh_coord
- Fix in converter: When converting a 3D file in VTK ouput had Z set to 0.0 now it is given the proper value
- Fix in rescan: Optimization of rescan (done by Judicael)
- Fix in hermes: Error in get_data_values when reading less data than what is in the field
- Defaut endian output is big_endian but can be now define to little edian by adding -DLITTLE_ENDIAN
- Fix for TELEMAC2D: bug in the convergence feature with ditributive schemes
- Fix in SISYPHE: Coefficient for the Engelund and Hansen formula(s) assigned to the standard value
- Fix in WAQTEL: Wrong index for work arrays T2_1 (in calcs3d_o2 and calcs3d_eutro)
- Fix in waq2d_thermic example: 1 wrong keyword (ASCII ATMOSPHERIC DATA FILE instead of FORMATTED DATA FILE 1)
and 1 wrong value for 1 keyword (2 instead of the default one) since 2016!
- Fix in WAQTEL: Variable computed too late in the CALCS2D_THERMIC.
The computation of P_VAP_SAT is moved before its use for the computation of PATMC
- Fix in TELEMAC-3D: Wrong MESH for one operation on structures (MESH3D rather than MESH2D)
when modelling drogues in spherical coordinates
- Fix in WAQTEL: Wrong definition of source terms (explicit/implicit) in CALCS3D_O2 changed in r10016


Release V7P3R0 (22/12/17)
===========================

- all modules: FORTRAN FILE can be a folder that contains several files,
  not a single file (but still possible)
- TELEMAC-2D/TELEMAC-3D: fix the culvert formulation 1 so that
  it falls back to the siphon formulation in that specific case.
- TELEMAC-2D/TELEMAC-3D: sources can also be assigned with global node numbers
- TELEMAC-2D/TELEMAC-3D: Lambert 93 projection when modelling tide.
- TELEMAC-2D/TELEMAC-3D: Adding 7 extra harmonic constituents,
  for FES2014 tidal database (M3, M8, Msf, N4, S1, Sa, SSa).
- TELEMAC-3D: remove the option DIFFUS. This option was meant
  to remove the diffusion but it actually did not
  remove the diffusion on U,V. Besides, it could happen that when using
  DIFFUS=NO the source terms were not included in W and the tracers.
  We thus chose to remove this option altogether. From now on, to
  disable the diffusion the user can only set a zero diffusion coefficient.
- TELEMAC-3D: remove the option OPTDIF to keep only one formulation
  (OPTDIF could take the values 1 or 2 but the
  option 2 did not seem to bring improvements compared to the option 1.
  It was was not used in any test-case, neither documented so we only kept
  the option 1 in the code)
- TELEMAC-3D: modular CONDIM and BORD3D subroutines (initial conditions
  and boundary conditions). Simplification of the CONDIM subroutine
  (initial conditions + mesh transformation), now split into several
  subroutines which do various and separated treatments (e.g. initial
  conditions for water depths, velocities, tracers... or mesh
  transformation different from the classical sigma transformation).
  The user only needs to fill one short file per variable. No need to
  keep the whole CONDIM subroutine.
  For BORD3D, every specific treatment is implemented in a separate
  subroutine USER_BORD3D called by BORD3D (see examples to fill).
- ARTEMIS: Creation of free surface elevation (time/space varying) files.
- ARTEMIS: Removing the need to code within BORH (using LECLIM and
the BOUNDARY CONDITION FILE instead).
- ARTEMIS: Automated calculation of the phase for incident boundaries
  (in PHBOR), starting from the "node of attack" of the offshore wave,
  iteratively computed along both sides away from the attack node
  along the rest of the incident boundary.
- STBTEL: Now refining the boundary conditions as well as the mesh
  Available through the script convertert.py as well
- Addons: Adding vim-syntax for .cas and .dico files
- TELEMAC-2D: change computation of wall distance (used in
  Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model). The wall distance (WDIST) is now
  computed in parallel with a laplacian operator.
- TELEMAC-2D: new framework for automatic convergence studies
- TELEMAC-3D: coupling with the water quality library AED2.
- TOMAWAC: Automatic imposed spectrum on nested mesh.
- TOMAWAC: In order to better take into account boundary conditions Limwac is called at the end of the loop in time instead of beginning.
- TELEMAC-2D: I/O criteria of result file now homogenous with FE or FV (steered by time-step and
period for graphic output)
- TELEMAC-2D: Activation of source terms for FV (Mass and Momentum): so far only partially
implemented for mass source terms.
- TELEMAC-2D: New turbulence model (Spalart-Allmaras)

Release V7P2R0 (31 Dec 2016)
===========================

Features
---------------------

- TELEMAC-2D: Add Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model.
- TelApy: Add the first structure for PYTHON API of TELEMAC.
- TELEMAC-3D: Add a new advection scheme (less diffusive scheme
  as in TELEMAC-2D).
- TELEMAC: Add possibility to prescribe space and time varying meteo
  conditions based on a file (ASCII ATMOSPHERIC DATA FILE and
  BINARY ATMOSPHERIC DATA FILE keywords).
- SISYPHE: Liquid boundaries file for bed load discharge.
- Replacing DredgeSim with Nestor.
- TELEMAC-2D: Add a new rainfall-runoff model. An example of use is given in
  the pluie test case.
- Automatic detection of Little/Big Endian for Serafin File
  (needs FORTRAN Gnu extension).
- TELEMAC-2D: Adding a deall_telemac2d subroutine that dallocates all that was
  allocated by point_telemac2d. Same thing for bief_all* and do on. This is
  mainly for API as in normal run the Fortran is cleaning on its own.
- TELEMAC-2D and 3D: new option for culvert modeling, change in the culvert parameters file.
- Adding NEWS file that contains the major modifications in the code.
- Integration of the MASCARET source code into the TELEMAC-MASCARET system

- TELEMAC-2D and 3D: possibility to read space-time varying meteo data from a
  binary file.
- TELEMAC-3D: possiblity to read space-time varying open boundary conditions
  from a binary file.

Addons
---------------------

- New version of ParaView plugin (SerafinReader) which allows to read Serafin
  file in Paraview.

Documentation
---------------------

- New developer guide in documentation/Misc/developer_guide.
- LaTeX documentation in folder documentation.
