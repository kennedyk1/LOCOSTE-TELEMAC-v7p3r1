\section{Features of Fortran 90 used in \bief:}
%
We briefly explain hereafter features of FORTRAN 90 that are used in \bief. For
more detailed explanations please refer to a real Fortran 90 book, such as
\citet{Metcalf1990}.

\subsection{Structures}

FORTRAN 77 only recognises integers, real numbers, Boolean and character
strings. FORTRAN 90 can be used to create structures. The following is an
example of the creation of a 'point' type structure composed of two real
numbers, and a circle structure, composed of a centre and a radius:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
TYPE point
  REAL :: x,y
END TYPE
!
TYPE circle
  TYPE(point) :: centre
  REAL :: radius
END TYPE
\end{lstlisting}

It can be observed that the centre is itself a structure of a type previously
defined. Once the structure has been defined, objects of this type can be
declared:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
TYPE(circle) :: ROND
\end{lstlisting}
ROND will be a circle with its centre and radius; the latter are obtained
thanks to the \% "component selector". Thus the radius of \telkey{ROND} will be
the real \telkey{ROND\%radius}.

\subsection{Pointers}

Pointers are well known in C language, but are notably different in Fortran 90.
Pointers in Fortran 90 may be used as pointers as in C but also as aliases.
Unlike C, they are not mere addresses pointing to somewhere in the computer
memory. The target must be defined precisely, for example the line:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
REAL, POINTER, DIMENSION(:) :: X
\end{lstlisting}
will define a pointer to a one-dimensional real array, and it will be
impossible to have it pointing to an integer nor even to a 2-dimensional array.
This pointer X will have then to be pointed to a target by the statement:


\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
X => Y
\end{lstlisting}
where Y is an already existing one-dimensional real array. Then X can be used as
if it were Y, it is thus an alias.

X can be also directly allocated as a normal array by the statement:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
ALLOCATE(X(100))
\end{lstlisting}
to have (for example) an array of 100 values. In this case X and its target
have the same name.
\\
A well known problem in Fortran 90 is the fact that arrays of pointers do not
exist. To overcome this problem, one has to create a new structure which is
itself a pointer, and to declare an array of this new structure. This is done
for blocks, which are lists of pointers to \telkey{BIEF\_OBJ} structures.

\subsection{Modules}

Modules are like INCLUDE statements, but are more clever, so that INCLUDE
should now always be avoided. As a matter of fact, modules can be used to
define global variables that will be accessible to all routines. With the
following module:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
MODULE EXAMPLE
  INTEGER EX1,EX2,EX3,EX4
END MODULE EXAMPLE
\end{lstlisting}
all the subroutines beginning with the statement: \telkey{USE EXAMPLE} will
have access to the same numbers \telkey{EX1,\ldots EX4}. With \telkey{INCLUDE}
statements, it would be only local variables without link to
\telkey{EX1,\ldots} declared in other subroutines.
\\
Modules will thus be used to define global variables that will be accessed via
a USE statement. If only one or several objects must be accessed, the ONLY
statement may be used, as in the example below:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
USE EXAMPLE, ONLY : EX1,EX2
\end{lstlisting}
This will enable to avoid name conflicts and secures programming.
\\
Modules are also used to store interfaces that will be shared between several
subroutines (see paragraph below)

\subsection{Interfaces}

Interfaces are a mean given to the compiler to check arguments of subroutines
even if it has no access to them. For example, the following interface:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
INTERFACE
  LOGICAL FUNCTION EOF(LUNIT)
    INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: LUNIT
  END FUNCTION
END INTERFACE
\end{lstlisting}
says that function \telkey{EOF} has one integer argument. \telkey{INTENT(IN)}
indicates that argument LUNIT is not changed. Interfaces of all \bief
subroutines have been put in a single module called \bief. a \telkey{USE BIEF}
statement at the beginning of a subroutine will prompt the compiler to check
the arguments and also do some optimisations in view of the \telkey{INTENT}
information (which can be \telkey{IN}, \telkey{OUT}, or \telkey{INOUT}
depending on the use of the argument). If a function is declared in an
interface, it must not be declared as an \telkey{EXTERNAL FUNCTION}.

\subsection{Interface operator}

New operations on structures could also be defined with the \telkey{INTERFACE
OPERATOR} statement. For example a sum of two vectors as stored in \bief could
be defined so that the line:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
CALL OS('X=Y     ',U,V,V,0.D0)
\end{lstlisting}
could be replaced by:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
U=V
\end{lstlisting}
Such interface operators \textbf{have not been done} in this code , because
operations like \telkey{U=A+B+C} would probably not be optimised and would
trigger a number of unnecessary copies.

\subsection{Optional parameters}

Subroutines may now have optional parameters. Thanks to this new feature,
subroutines OS and OSD of previous releases have been grouped in a single one.
Hereafter is given the interface of new subroutine OS:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
INTERFACE
SUBROUTINE OS( OP, X , Y , Z , C , IOPT , INFINI , ZERO )
 USE BIEF_DEF
 INTEGER, INTENT(IN), OPTIONAL :: IOPT
 DOUBLE PRECISION, INTENT(IN), OPTIONAL, INFINI, ZERO
 TYPE(BIEF_OBJ), INTENT(INOUT), OPTIONAL :: X
 TYPE(BIEF_OBJ), INTENT(IN), OPTIONAL :: Y,Z
 DOUBLE PRECISION, INTENT(IN), OPTIONAL :: C
 CHARACTER(LEN=8), INTENT(IN) :: OP
END SUBROUTINE

END INTERFACE
\end{lstlisting}

Subroutine OS performs on structure X the operation given in OP, e.g.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
CALL OS('X=0     ',X=TRA01)
\end{lstlisting}
Or:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
CALL OS('X=Y     ',X=TAB1,Y=TAB2)
\end{lstlisting}
Parameters Y,Z and C are used only for specific operations and otherwise are
not necessary. When a parameter is missing and to avoid ambiguity, the
parameters must be named, hence the \telkey{X=TRA01} in the example above.

Parameters IOPT, INFINI and ZERO stem from the old subroutine OSD and are used
only when a division is implied in the operation asked, for example if \telkey{OP =
'X=Y/Z   '}. These 3 parameters are now optional. When they are present, it is
better to name them as is done in the following line:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
CALL OS('X=Y/Z   ',U,V,W,0.D0,IOPT=2,INFINI=1.D0,ZERO=1.D-10)
\end{lstlisting}

The use of optional parameters will enable a better compatibility between
different versions because it will be possible to add a new parameter as an
optional one.

Optional arguments will be written between brackets [ ] in argument lists in the
rest of the document.

\section{Structures in \bief}
%

\subsection{A short description}

In \bief structures will be composed of integer and real numbers, of pointers to
other structures or to integer and real arrays. The structures defined in this
way are, for the time being, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item BIEF\_OBJ (may be a vector, a matrix or a block)
\item BIEF\_MESH (information on a mesh)
\item SLVCFG (Solver Configuration)
\item BIEF\_FILE (Description of a data file)
\end{itemize}
The notions of \telkey{VECTOR}, \telkey{MATRIX} and \telkey{BLOCK} that were
pre-programmed in \bief 6.2 have been gathered in a single structure called
\telkey{BIEF\_OBJ}. This will enable what is called "polymorphism" in Object
Oriented Languages, i.e. the fact that arguments of subroutines may be of
different types. As a matter of fact, many subroutines in \bief are able to
treat in the same way vectors or blocks of vectors (see for example OS),
matrices or blocks of matrices (see e.g. \telkey{SOLVE} and \telkey{DIRICH}).
Polymorphism is possible in FORTRAN 90 with the use of interfaces, however it
requires the writing of one subroutine per combination of types, and thus leads
to a lot of duplication. The use of a single structure \telkey{BIEF\_OBJ} was
thus more elegant, the only drawback being that the misuse of a matrix as a
vector, for example, cannot be checked by the compiler but only by the
subroutines dealing with such structures.


Information on the structures can be simply retrieved by the component
selector.


We shall also refer to \telkey{BIEF\_OBJ} structures as \telkey{VECTOR},
\telkey{MATRIX} or \telkey{BLOCK}, depending on their use, as is done below:

\paragraph{VECTOR}

This may be any vector (a simple array) or a vector defined on the mesh, with
values for every point of the mesh. In the latter case, there is a
corresponding discretisation type and numbering system (global or boundary
numbering of nodes or numbering of elements). For example, a vector defined on
all the mesh with a discretisation P0 will be implicitly given according to the
element numbers. In certain conditions, a vector may change discretisation
while the calculations are being carried out.

A vector has a first dimension which corresponds to the number of nodes to
which it applies. There is also a second dimension (for example, the
off-diagonal terms of a matrix).

Any vector is in fact an array with 2 dimensions which the user can process as
he wishes.

\paragraph{MATRIX}

Matrices are also linked to the mesh. Different storage methods are possible.
These matrices can be multiplied by the vectors mentioned above.

\paragraph{BLOCK}

A block is a set of structures. This notion has proved of particular importance for:
\begin{itemize}
\item Writing general solvers for linear systems, with the possibility of the
  matrix being a block of several matrices.
\item Using simple orders to group together and process sets of vectors or
  matrices, for example the arrays of variables which are advected by the
  method of characteristics.
\item Eliminate the need for certain arrays to follow one another in the
  memory.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{\telkey{BIEF\_MESH} structure}

This structure includes all information concerning the mesh (connectivity
tables, boundary points, point coordinates, etc.). It replaces a large number
of arrays used in releases of \bief prior to 3.2

\paragraph{SLVCFG}

It stands for "SoLVer ConFiGuration). This is a simple structure to store all
the information needed by the subroutine SOLVE for solving linear systems
(choice of the method, accuracy, preconditioning, etc).

\subsection{Allocation of structures}

Once declared, \telkey{BIEF\_OBJ} structures must be defined and memory for
their arrays of data must be dynamically allocated. This is done by specific
subroutines, depending of their type, i.e. whether they are vectors, matrices
or blocks. \telkey{BIEF\_MESH} structure must also be allocated.

The allocations of structures are grouped in a subroutine called
\telkey{POINT\_NAME} (NAME is the name of a \telemacsystem program, for example
\artemis).

\textbf{The mesh structure must be allocated first}. Vectors and matrices will
then be allocated with respect to that mesh.

\paragraph{Mesh: subroutine \telkey{ALMESH}}

A mesh must be declared previously as a \telkey{BIEF\_MESH} structure

\underbar{Syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
CALL ALMESH( MESH, NOM, IELM, SPHERI,CFG,NFIC,
             EQUA,NPLAN,NPMAX,NPTFRX,NELMAX,I3,I4)
\end{lstlisting}

\telkey{ALMESH} prepares the \telkey{BIEF\_MESH} structures and fills some of
them, for example it will allocate the memory for storing the component
\telkey{IKLE} and will read it in the geometry file. However not all the data
structure is ready after exiting \telkey{ALMESH}. This task is carried out by
the subroutine \telkey{INBIEF} which must be called later, when all the
necessary data have been logged.

\underbar{Arguments}:
\begin{description}
\item [MESH] The BIEF\_MESH structure to allocate.
\item [NOM] Fortran name of this structure in 6 characters.
\item [IELM] Element with the highest number of degrees of freedom in the mesh.
  \begin{description}
  \item [11] only linear interpolation in 2D
  \item [12] quasi-bubble in 2D
  \item [41] linear in 3D with prisms
  \end{description}
\item [SPHERI] Logical. If true, coordinates will be spherical, if not, Cartesian.
\item [CFG] Configuration. So far 2 integer values:
  \begin{description}
    \item [CFG(1)] is the storage of matrices (1: classical EBE, 3: edge-based)
    \item [CFG(2)] is the matrix-vector product (1: classical EBE, 2: frontal)
  \end{description}
   These data will be used to build specific data structures relevant to
   every option.
\item [NFIC] Logical unit where the geometry file has been opened.
\item [EQUA] Equations to solve or calling programme in 20 characters. Up to
  now is only used to allocate specific arrays for Finite volumes if
  \telkey{EQUA='SAINT-VENANT VF'} is used to optimise memory requirements.
\end{description}

Next 6 arguments are optional:
\begin{description}
\item [NPLAN] Number of horizontal planes in 3D meshes of prisms.
\item [NPMAX] Maximum number of vertices in the mesh, in case of adaptive
  meshing (not implemented yet).
\item [NPTFRX] Maximum number of boundary points in the mesh, in case of
  adaptive meshing (not implemented yet).
\item [NELMAX] Maximum number of elements in the mesh, in case of adaptive
  meshing (not implemented yet).
\item [I3, I4] When present, it means that the X and Y coordinates of the mesh
  are in reality X+I3 and Y+I4, I3 and I4 (integers representing a number of
  metres, have been removed to minimize truncation errors (see also the Selafin
  format where these two numbers are included for a geo-referenced
  post-processing.
\end{description}

\paragraph{Vector : \telkey{BIEF\_ALLVEC} , \telkey{BIEF\_ALLVEC\_IN\_BLOCK}}

A vector must be declared previously as a \telkey{BIEF\_OBJ} structure

\underbar{Syntax:}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
CALL BIEF_ALLVEC(NAT,VEC,NOM,IELM,DIM2,STATUT,MESH)
\end{lstlisting}

\underbar{Arguments:}
\begin{description}
\item [NAT] Nature (1=real, 2=integer).
\item [VEC] The BIEF\_OBJ structure to be allocated as a vector.
\item [NOM] Fortran name of vector in 6 characters.
\item [IELM] Vector discretisation type (\textbf{or dimension depending on
  the status}, \textbf{see below})
\begin{description}
  \item [0] dimension 1, constant per element.
  \item [1] dimension 1 linear discretisation.
  \item [10] triangles, constant discretisation per element.
  \item [11] triangles, linear discretisation.
  \item [12] triangles, quasi-bubble discretisation.
  \item [40] prism, constant discretisation per element.
  \item [41] prism, linear discretisation.
\end{description}
\item [DIM2] Second dimension of vector.
\item [STATUT]
 \begin{description}
   \item [0] Any array. \textbf{IELM is then its first dimension}.
   \item [1] Vector defined on a mesh, with no possibility of changing
     discretisation.
   \item [2] Vector defined on a mesh, with possibility of changing
     discretisation within   the limits of the memory space.
\end{description}
\item [MESH] the BIEF\_MESH structure with data on the mesh.
\end{description}

\underbar{Syntax:}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
CALL BIEF_ALLVEC_IN_BLOCK( BLO,N,NAT,NOM,IELM,DIM2,STATUT)
\end{lstlisting}

With \telkey{BIEF\_ALLVEC\_IN\_BLOCK}, N vectors with the same characteristics
are put directly into the block BLO. NOM is then only a generic name, for
example if NOM is 'T     ', the names of the vectors will be T1, T2, etc. Only
the block BLO must be declared. T2 will be in fact BLO\%ADR(2)\%P but can be
named also T2 if T2 is declared as a \telkey{BIEF\_OBJ} pointer and pointed to
BLO\%ADR(2)\%P:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
TYPE(BIEF_OBJ), POINTER :: T2
T2 => BLO%ADR(2)%P
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Matrix: \telkey{BIEF\_ALLMAT}}

A matrix must be declared previously as a \telkey{BIEF\_OBJ} structure. We only
deal with matrices of double precision numbers.

\underbar{Syntax:}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
CALL BIEF_ALLMAT( MAT,NOM,IELM1,IELM2,
CFG,TYPDIA,TYPEXT,MESH)
\end{lstlisting}

\underbar{Arguments:}
\begin{description}
\item [MAT] The BIEF\_OBJ structure to be allocated as a vector.
\item [NOM] Fortran name of matrix in 6 characters.
\item [IELM1] Type of discretisation for rows (same convention as for the
  vectors).
\item [IELM2] Type of discretisation for columns.
\item [CFG] Configuration. So far 2 integer values:
\begin{itemize}
  \item CFG(1) is the storage of matrices (1: EBE, 3: edge based)
  \item CFG(2) is the matrix-vector product (1: EBE, 2: frontal)
\end{itemize}
\item [TYPDIA] Diagonal type ('0' : zero, 'Q' : any, 'I' : identity)
\item [TYPEXT] Type of the off-diagonal terms ('0': zero, 'Q': any, 'S':
  symmetrical)
\item [MESH]  : Bief\_mesh structure with data on the mesh.
\end{description}

\paragraph{Block : ALLBLO}

A block must be declared previously as a \telkey{BIEF\_OBJ} structure.

\underbar{Syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
CALL ALLBLO(BLO,NOM)
\end{lstlisting}

\underbar{Arguments}:
\begin{description}
  \item [BLO] The BIEF\_OBJ structure to be allocated as a block.
  \item [NOM] Fortran name of block in 6 characters.
\end{description}
In this case, we have an empty shell where we do not specify which objects have
been placed in the block. A block structure can thus be used again. To fill the
block, the subroutine ADDBLO must then be called (see paragraph A.I.4.4). The
syntax will be:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
CALL ADDBLO(BLOCK,OBJ)
\end{lstlisting}
to add a BIEF\_OBJ structure OBJ to the block called BLOCK.

A block can be emptied by calling a simple function:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
CALL DEALLBLO(BLOCK)
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Example}

We take here the example of a double precision array called SAMPLE, with one
dimension, and quasi-bubble discretisation. This vector will be then set to a
constant value.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Declare the structure:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
TYPE(BIEF_OBJ) :: SAMPLE
\end{lstlisting}
in a global declaration through a module, or locally.

  \item Allocate the structure:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
CALL BIEF_ALLVEC(1,SAMPLE,'SAMPLE',12,1,STATUT,MESH)
\end{lstlisting}

  \item To set the value of the vector to 5.D0 for all points of the mesh, you
    can then do:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
CALL OS('X=C     ',X=SAMPLE,C=5.D0)
\end{lstlisting}
which is equivalent in this case to (but the following would require
declaration of integer I):

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
DO I=1,SAMPLE%DIM1
   SAMPLE%R(I)=5.D0
ENDDO
\end{lstlisting}
\end{enumerate}
To understand this loop, remember that R is the component storing the real data
of vectors, and DIM1 the size of the first dimension. However it is not
mandatory to remember this if you use the functions and subroutines designed
for operations on structures.

\subsection{Operations on structures}

The functions and subroutines described below are used for manipulating
structures without having to know how they are arranged. This paragraph will be
limited to the functions related to the notion of structure itself. The
traditional operations on matrices and vectors will be dealt with in Chapter
\ref{ref:matvec}.

All the functions described hereafter will be naturally declared by a USE BIEF
statement at the beginning of subroutines. Otherwise they would have to be
declared as EXTERNAL.

\paragraph{General operations on structures}

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
LOGICAL FUNCTION CMPOBJ(T1,T2)
\end{lstlisting}

\underbar{arguments}:
\begin{description}
  \item [T1,T2]a vector or a block
\end{description}

\telkey{CMPOBJ} indicates if the two structures are identical. A check is made to see
whether these two structures are of the same type and, if so, their
characteristics are compared:
\begin{itemize}
  \item for vectors: discretisation.
  \item for blocks: the number of structures that it contains.
\end{itemize}

Nothing has been done so far for the other structures.

This function is used by subroutine OS.

\paragraph{Operations on vectors}

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE CHGDIS(VEC,OLDELT,NEWELT,MESH)
\end{lstlisting}

CHGDIS changes the discretisation of a vector.

\underbar{arguments}:
\begin{description}
  \item [VEC] is the vector
  \item [MESH] the structure containing the mesh integers
  \item [OLDELT] is the former vector discretisation
  \item [NEWELT] is the new one
\end{description}
A vector can thus go from a linear discretisation to a quasi-bubble
discretisation, or the reverse. In the first case, the missing values are found
by linear interpolation, while in the second case the superfluous values are
forgotten. There are certain restrictions to the use of this subroutine:
\begin{itemize}
  \item a vector cannot be extended if the required memory space is not
    provided for during allocation.
  \item Certain changes are impossible, for obvious reasons: changing a
    triangle to a quadrilateral, etc.
\end{itemize}
\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE CPSTVC(T1,T2)
\end{lstlisting}

This subroutine copies a vector structure onto another. If  T1 is a vector, T2
then becomes a vector with the same characteristics. Nevertheless, the memory
allocated during allocation cannot be changed. The only data copied for the
moment are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Discretisation type (component ELM)
  \item The first dimension (component DIM1)
  \item The second dimension (component DIM2)
  \item The component DIMDISC in case of discontinuous vectors.
\end{itemize}

This subroutine should be used when dealing with temporary all purpose
\telkey{BIEF\_OBJ} structures like T1, T2, etc. in \telemac{2D} and \sisyphe
and T3\_01, T3\_02, etc. in \telemac{3D}. As a matter of fact, these structures
may have been changed by a previous use, e.g. they may have been turned into
boundary vectors with a smaller size than a full domain vector, hence an
initialisation like \telkey{CALL OS(`X=0     `,X=T1)} may have a random effect
if not secured previously by specifying what must be T1. Copying the structure
of a known object like e.g.  the depth in structure H, will do it. \telkey{CALL
CPSTVC(H,T1)} will give T1 the same dimension and discretisation as the depth.

\paragraph{Operations on matrices}

Note : all the operations on vectors may also be applied to the diagonal and
the extradiagonal terms contained in the matrix structure (respectively
\telkey{M\%D} and \telkey{M\%X} for a matrix M). The following subroutines only
 apply to matrices:

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE CPSTMT(M1,M2,TRANS)
\end{lstlisting}

Copies characteristics of the matrix M1 on to the matrix M2, or of transposed
of matrix M1 to M2 (if optional argument TRANS is set to true).

\telkey{CPSTMT} is similar to \telkey{CPSTVC}, it carries out the following
operations:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item copies types of elements.
  \item copies types of diagonal and off-diagonal terms (calls CPSTVC for the
    diagonal and the off-diagonal terms).
  \item copies characteristics of the matrix (components TYPDIA and TYPEXT).
  \item checks that M2 has enough memory for its new characteristics : sizes of
    diagonal and extra-diagonal terms.
\end{enumerate}
\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
INTEGER FUNCTION BIEF_DIM1_EXT(IELM1,IELM2,STO,TYPEXT,MESH)
\end{lstlisting}

The extra-diagonal terms of matrices are stored in 2-dimensional arrays.
DIM1\_EXT returns the first dimension of this array, depending on:
\underbar{arguments}:
\begin{description}
  \item [IELM1] Type of discretisation for rows (same convention as for the
    vectors).
  \item [IELM2] Type of discretisation for columns.
  \item [STO]: Storage of the matrix (1: EBE, 3: edge based)
  \item [TYPEXT] Type of the off-diagonal terms ('0': zero, 'Q': any, 'S':
    symmetrical)
  \item [MESH] \telkey{BIEF\_MESH} structure with data on the mesh.
\end{description}

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
INTEGER FUNCTION BIEF_DIM2_EXT(IELM1,IELM2,STO,TYPEXT,MESH)
\end{lstlisting}

The extra-diagonal terms of matrices are stored in 2-dimensional arrays.
\telkey{DIM2\_EXT} returns the second dimension of this array, depending on:
\underbar{arguments}:
\begin{description}
  \item [IELM1] Type of discretisation for rows (same convention as for the
    vectors).
  \item [IELM2] Type of discretisation for columns.
  \item [STO] Storage of the matrix (1: EBE, 3: edge based)
  \item [TYPEXT] Type of the off-diagonal terms ('0': zero, 'Q': any, 'S':
    symmetrical)
  \item [MESH] \telkey{BIEF\_MESH} structure with data on the mesh.
\end{description}

\paragraph{Operations on blocks}

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE ADDBLO(BLOCK,T)
\end{lstlisting}
Adds the structure T to the block.

\underbar{arguments}:
\begin{description}
  \item [BLOCK] is a block
  \item [T] a structure.
\end{description}

\paragraph{Reaching objects in blocks}

If T1 is a vector stored as the second object in a block B, the address of T1
is B\%ADR(2)\%P. As a matter of fact, ADR is an array of
\telkey{POINTER\_TO\_BIEF\_OBJ} structures, we take the second one, and its unique
component P (P would not be present if Fortran 90 were accepting the arrays of
pointers).
\\
\telkey{B\%ADR(2)\%P} can then be treated as a \telkey{BIEF\_OBJ} structure,
  for example the third real value of T1 is \telkey{B\%ADR(2)\%P\%R(3)}. It is
    not recommended to deal directly with objects in blocks, this can be done
    in a subroutine by calling it with the argument (e.g.)
    \telkey{B\%ADR(2)\%P}. It will be then received in the subroutine as a
      normal \telkey{BIEF\_OBJ} structure.
\\
Component selectors can be piled up if blocks themselves are stored in blocks
as in the following example, where T1 as been stored as the second object into
a block C stored as the third object in the block B. T1 is then:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
B%ADR[3]%P%ADR[2]%P
\end{lstlisting}
The only difficulty and common error is to forget the component P which is due
to Fortran obscure reasons.

\section{Building matrices and vectors}
\label{ref:matvec}

The subroutines \telkey{MATRIX} and \telkey{VECTOR} construct matrices and
vectors respectively, according to the instructions given in their arguments.

\subsection{Construction of matrices}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE MATRIX( M,OP,FORMUL,IELM1,IELM2,
                   XMUL,F,G,H,U,V,W,MESH,MSK,MASKEL )
\end{lstlisting}
The result is the matrix M, with row element IELM1 and column element IELM2,
constructed according to the formula FORMUL and the operation OP (see below).
XMUL, F ,G ,H ,U ,V ,W are respectively a constant and six vector structures
(defined with \telkey{TYPE(BIEF\_OBJ)}) used in the definition of the matrix. The
discretisation of F, G, H, U, V and W is checked and is taken into account in
the calculations. These last six structures must not be dummy arguments, even
if they are not used.

The other arguments are:
\begin{description}
  \item [MESH] Mesh declared as a BIEF\_MESH structure.
  \item [MSK] Logical. Indicates if the elements are masked.
  \item [MASKEL] Element masking array.
\end{description}

\paragraph{Possible operations}

OP is an operation coded in 8 characters, as for the subroutine OM. N is an
internal working matrix which contains the matrix with the formula requested
(see next paragraph). M is the matrix given by the user and which will be
modified according to the operation indicated:

\begin{itemize}
  \item OP = 'M=N     ' : COPY OF N ON TO M
  \item OP = 'M=TN    ' : COPY OF TRANSPOSED OF N ON TO M
  \item OP = 'M=M+N   ' : N IS ADDED TO M
  \item OP = 'M=M+TN  ' : TRANSPOSED OF N IS ADDED TO M
\end{itemize}

The operations with the form M=M+CN can be carried out through the multiplying
factor XMUL which applies to N.

\paragraph{Available formulae}

FORMUL is a string of 16 characters describing the formula. Generally only the
first 6 are used but extra information may be contained in characters 7 to 16.
For example the sixteenth character is sometimes used to specify the
derivatives and may then contain the characters X, Y or Z.

\paragraph{Available elements}

All the possible formulae are given below. However, all the discretisation
combinations are not programmed. If a matrix or a given discretisation has not
been programmed, an error message will appear to this effect.

In the next part of the text,$\Psi _{i} $ is the base corresponding to the
element IELM1 (row) and $\Psi _{j} $ the base corresponding to the element
IELM2 (column). The example of dimension 3 is given. For the other dimensions,
some terms would of course have to be removed. The beginning of names of the
corresponding subroutines in \bief are given in brackets. They are complemented
by letters indicating the elements treated. The first letter corresponds to the
row and the second letter to the column. Letter O stands for a linear segment,
A for a linear triangle, B for a quasi-bubble triangle, C for a quadratic
triangle, P for a prism, T for a tetrahedron. More specifically F stands for a
vertical linear triangle which is part of the vertical border of a mesh of
prisms split into tetrahedrons. Example : subroutine MT01AA will compute the
mass-matrix of a linear triangle.

\underbar{FORMUL = 'MATMAS          ' }

(in library \bief subroutines with names which start with \telkey{MT01})

Mass-matrix.

\[N(i,j)=XMUL \int _{\Omega }\Psi _{i} \Psi _{j} d\Omega  \]

\underbar{FORMUL = 'MATDIF          '}

(in library \bief subroutines with names which start with \telkey{MT02})

Diffusion matrix with different coefficients according to the directions x, y
and z.

\textbf{In 2 dimensions:}
\[N(i,j)=XMUL \int _{\Omega }
(U\frac{\partial \Psi _{i} }{\partial x}
  \frac{\partial \Psi _{j} }{\partial x}
 +U\frac{\partial \Psi _{i} }{\partial y}
   \frac{\partial \Psi _{j} }{\partial y} )d\Omega  \]

The case of an isotropic viscosity is given above. But the viscosity may also
be tensorial. In this case U (a\telkey{ BIEF\_OBJ} structure) must have a second
dimension, for example 3 in 2-dimensional applications. U will has the general
following form:
$U=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
    {U_{xx} } & {U_{xy} } \\
    {U_{yx} } & {U_{yy} }
\end{array}\right)$
, but the tensor is symmetric and Uxy = Uyx.

Elements of the tensor must be stored in U as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $U_{xx}$ in U(*,1)
  \item $U_{yy}$ in U(*,2)
  \item $U_{xy}$ in U(*,3)
\end{itemize}

In a 2D non isotropic case, the diffusion matrix is of the form:

\[
  N(i,j)=XMUL \int _{\Omega }
(U_{xx} \frac{\partial \Psi _{i} }{\partial x}
        \frac{\partial \Psi _{j} }{\partial x}
 +U_{yy} \frac{\partial \Psi _{i} }{\partial y}
         \frac{\partial \Psi _{j} }{\partial y}
 +U_{xy} \frac{\partial \Psi _{i} }{\partial x}
         \frac{\partial \Psi _{j} }{\partial y}
 +U_{xy} \frac{\partial \Psi _{i} }{\partial y}
         \frac{\partial \Psi _{j} }{\partial x} )d\Omega
\]

When a transversal Kt and longitudinal Kl dispersion are used (case of Elder's
turbulence model), the formula giving the tensor U is:

\[U_{xx} =Kl \cos (\theta )^{2} +Kt \sin (\theta )^{2} \]

\[U_{yy} =Kl \sin (\theta )^{2} +Kt \cos (\theta )^{2} \]

\[U_{xy} =(Kl-Kt) (\sin (\theta )- \cos (\theta ))\]

\textbf{In 3 dimensions (beware, F, G and H are used in this case, unlike in 2D
where U,V and W are used):}

\[
  N(i,j)=XMUL
\int _{\Omega }
(F\frac{\partial \Psi _{i} }{\partial x}
  \frac{\partial \Psi _{j} }{\partial x}
+G\frac{\partial \Psi _{i} }{\partial y}
  \frac{\partial \Psi _{j} }{\partial y}
+H\frac{\partial \Psi _{i} }{\partial z}
  \frac{\partial \Psi _{j} }{\partial z} )d\Omega
\]

\underbar{FORMUL = 'MATDIF2         '}

In 3D only, formula MATDIF2 is like \telkey{MATDIF}, but the
hydrostatic inconsistencies are dealt with.

\underbar{FORMUL = 'MATDIF3         '}

In 2D only so far, diffusion matrix with diffusion coefficients which are
piece-wise linear or constant, but may be discontinuous between elements (this
is used in groundwater flows).

\]

\underbar{FORMUL = 'FFBT            '}

(subroutines with names which start with \telkey{MT99})

This is in fact a series of different matrices and the string FORMUL(8:16) is
also used for defining the formula. For example if FORMUL(8:16)='     0XX0',
the matrix will be:

\[N(i,j)=XMUL \int _{\Omega }F\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} \frac{\partial \Psi _{j} }{\partial x} \Psi _{i} d\Omega  \]

Explanation: the term in the integral is a product of 4 terms based, for the
first 2, on the vector F, and then on the Basis function called here B and the
test function called T.

If the first character is 0, the first term will be F.
If the first character is X, the first term will be $\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} $.
If the first character is Y, the first term will be $\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} $.

Then we proceed to second character and again function F, to third character
and function $\Psi _{j} $, to fourth character and function $\Psi _{i} $.

Up to now the combinations 0XX0, 0YY0, XX00, 0X0Y, XY00, YY00, 0Y0X are
implemented. The formula FORMUL(8:16)='00XX+00YY' is also available. Note that
missing combinations can be obtained because the first two characters can be
exchanged. Moreover exchanging the last two characters gives the transposed
matrix of the previous formula.

The existing subroutines building matrices in version 6.2 are the following,
their function can be deduced from the explanations above:

\subsection{Construction of vectors}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE VECTOR( VEC,OP,FORMUL,IELM1,
   XMUL,F,G,H,U,V,W,
   MESH,MSK,MASKEL )
\end{lstlisting}

The principle is the same as for MATRIX. The result is the vector VEC, with
discretisation IELM1, constructed according to FORMUL and the operation OP (see
below).

XMUL, F ,G ,H ,U ,V ,W are respectively a constant and six vector structures
used in the definition of the new vector. The discretisation of F, G, H, U, V
and W is checked and is taken into account for the calculations.

the other arguments are the same as for MATRIX:

\paragraph{Possible operations}

OP may be equal to :
\begin{itemize}
  \item '=' : in this case the vector corresponds to the formula indicated.
  \item '+' : the formula indicated is added to VEC.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Available formulae}

FORMUL is a string of 16 characters the first 6 of which take the name of the
equivalent former subroutine in \bief version 3.0 (for certain, however, the
meaning has been changed). The sixteenth character is sometimes used to specify
the derivatives and may then contain the characters X, Y or Z.

All the possible formulae are given below. However, all the discretisation
combinations are not programmed. If a vector has not been programmed, an error
message will appear to this effect.

In the next part of the text, $\Psi _{i} $ is the base corresponding to the
element IELM1. The example of dimension 3 is given. For the other dimensions,
some terms would of course have to be removed. The names of the corresponding
subroutines in \bief 3.2 are given in brackets.

\underbar{FORMUL = 'MASBAS          '}

(subroutines with names which start with \telkey{VC00})

of 1 everywhere.

\[VEC(i)=XMUL
\int _{\Omega }
\vec{K} \overrightarrow{grad} ( \Psi _{i}  )
\vec{U} \overrightarrow{grad} ( F ) d\Omega  \]

$\vec{K}$ is a vector with the components G and H. (this would have to be
modified in dimension 3).

(used in 3D only)

(subroutines with names which start with \telkey{VC04})

\[VEC(i)=XMUL \int _{\Omega }\vec{U}_{2D}  \overrightarrow{grad} _{2D} ( \Psi _{i}  )  d\Omega  \]

$\vec{U}$ is a vector with the components U and V.

VGRADP is the same formula, with corrections when the generalised sigma
transformation is used.

\underbar{FORMUL = 'FLUBOR            '}

(subroutines with names which start with \telkey{VC05})

\[VEC(i)=XMUL \int _{\Gamma } \Psi _{i}   \vec{U} \vec{n} d\Gamma  \]

$\vec{U}$ is a vector with the components U, V and W.

$\vec{n}$ is the normal outer vector.

\underbar{FORMUL = 'FLUBOR2           '}

\underbar{FORMUL = 'FLUBDF          '}

(subroutines with names which start with \telkey{VC10})

\[VEC(i)=XMUL \int _{\Gamma } \Psi _{i}   F \vec{U} \vec{n} d\Gamma  \]

$\vec{U}$ is a vector with the components U, V and W.
$\vec{n}$ is the normal vector external to the domain.

\underbar{FORMUL = 'GGRADF         X'}

(subroutines with names which start with \telkey{VC11})

\[VEC(i)=XMUL \int _{\Omega }\Psi _{i}  G  \overrightarrow{grad} ( F )  d\Omega  \]

If FORMUL(16:16) is equal to 'Y' or 'Z' instead of 'X', the derivative will be
obtained according to y or z.

\underbar{FORMUL = 'GRADF          X'}

(subroutines with names which start with \telkey{VC13})

\[VEC(i)=XMUL \int _{\Omega }\Psi _{i}    \overrightarrow{grad} ( F )  d\Omega  \]

If FORMUL(16:16) is equal to 'Y' or 'Z' instead of 'X', the derivative will be
obtained according to y or z.

In 3 dimensions, variants are available:
\begin{itemize}
  \item GRADF(X,Y)     X and GRADF(X,Y)     Y will consider only the gradient
    of a function which does not depend on Z.
  \item GRADF2 will take care of hydrostatic inconsistencies.
\end{itemize}

\underbar{FORMUL = 'PRODF           '}

(subroutines with names which start with \telkey{VC14})

\[VEC(i)=XMUL \int _{\Omega }\Psi _{i}  F   (2 (\frac{\partial U}{\partial x} )^{2} +2 (\frac{\partial V}{\partial y} )^{2} +(\frac{\partial U}{\partial y} +\frac{\partial V}{\partial x} )^{2} )    d\Omega  \]

This vector is used in the calculation of the turbulent production with the
model k-epsilon.

\underbar{FORMUL = 'DIVQ            '}

(subroutines with names which start with \telkey{VC15})

\[VEC(i)=XMUL \int _{\Omega }\Psi _{i}  div(F \vec{U})  d\Omega  \]

\underbar{FORMUL = 'FLUDIF          '}

(subroutines with names which start with \telkey{VC17})

\[VEC(i)=XMUL \int _{\Omega }\Psi _{i}  U . \overrightarrow{grad} ( F ).\vec{n}  d\Omega  \]

This is not currently used nor implemented.

\underbar{FORMUL = 'VGRADF2          '}

(subroutines with names which start with \telkey{VC18})

\[VEC(i)=XMUL \int _{\Omega }\Psi _{i}  U . \overrightarrow{grad} ( F )  d\Omega  \]

This is specifically for 3D computations with prisms, and unlike VGRADF, the
test function $\Psi _{i} $ is here a 2-dimensional test function (no dependency
on z). This is used by \telemac{3D} in subroutine WSTARW.

\underbar{FORMUL = 'HUGRADP          '}

(subroutines with names which start with \telkey{VC19})

\[VEC(i)=XMUL \int _{\Omega }F \vec{U} . \overrightarrow{grad} ( \Psi _{i}  )  d\Omega  \]

This is used in 2D, mostly for computing fluxes. H in HUGRADP stands for the
depth denoted h, which can be misleading as it does not refer to the function H
which is an argument of subroutine VC19AA. A variant HUGRADP2 exists, in this
case the velocity is not only $\vec{U}$ of components (U,V), but $\vec{U}+G
 \overrightarrow{grad} ( H ) $. This is a way of treating the gradient
of the free surface elevation as a piecewise constant function, which it is in
reality when the depth is linear.

The existing subroutines building vectors in version 6.2 are the following,
their function can be deduced from the explanations above:

\section{Operations on matrices and vectors}

Some operations described below also apply to vectors contained in blocks,
since it is possible to place these blocks in the subroutine arguments.

\subsection{Operations on vectors}

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE OS(OP,X,Y,Z,C,[IOPT,INFINI,ZERO])
\end{lstlisting}

\underbar{Arguments}:
\begin{description}
  \item [OP] is a string of 8 characters describing an operation between X,Y,Z
  and C.
  \item [X] is a vector or a working array which will contain the result of the
    operation.
  \item [Y and Z] are vector structures. Y and Z can be dummy arguments if they
    do not appear in the operation, but they must be declared as BIEF\_OBJ
    structures. C is a double precision real number.

  \item [X,Y,Z,C,IOPT, INFINI and ZERO] are optional, the last 3 are used only
    when a division is implied in the operation asked, for example if OP =
    'X=Y/Z   '. When they are present, it is better to name them as is done in
    the following line:
\end{description}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
CALL OS('X=Y/Z   ',U,V,W,0.D0,IOPT=2,INFINI=1.D0,ZERO=1.D-10)
\end{lstlisting}

If IOPT = 1 : no check of division by 0 is made.

If IOPT = 2 : the infinite terms are replaced by the constant INFINI.

If IOPT = 3 : stop in the case of division by a number less than the parameter
ZERO.

If IOPT = 4 : infinite terms are truncated at the value 1.D0/ZERO or -1.D0/ZERO
(depending on their sign).

\begin{WarningBlock}{Warning:}
The structure of X is updated according to the result. Consistency checks
between X, Y and Z are applied. Y and Z must have the same discretisation.
\end{WarningBlock}

\underbar{Very important note:}

When Y is mentioned in the operation and X and Y have different
characteristics, the conflict is settled by copying the characteristics of Y
onto those of X (by a call to \telkey{CPSTVC}). This is done without
any warning message and means that vectors can be used as working arrays. Only
vectors allocated with a status equal to 1 will trigger an error message if a
change of their discretisation is tried.

The operation OP may be :
\begin{itemize}
  \item OP = 'X=C     ' :  C VALUE ASSIGNED TO ALL COMPONENTS OF X
  \item OP = 'X=0     ' :  C VALUE ASSIGNED TO ALL COMPONENTS OF X
  \item OP = 'X=Y     ' :  Y COPIED ON TO X
  \item OP = 'X=+Y    ' :  IDEM
  \item OP = 'X=-Y    ' : -Y COPIED ON TO X
  \item OP = 'X=1/Y   ' :  INVERSE OF Y COPIED ON TO X
  \item OP = 'X=Y+Z   ' :  SUM OF Y AND Z COPIED ON TO X
  \item OP = 'X=Y-Z   ' :  DIFFERENCE OF Y AND Z COPIED ON TO X
  \item OP = 'X=YZ    ' :  PRODUCT Y BY Z COPIED ON TO X
  \item OP = 'X=-YZ   ' :  PRODUCT Y BY Z COPIED ON TO X
  \item OP = 'X=XY    ' :  PRODUCT Y BY X COPIED ON TO X
  \item OP = 'X=X+YZ  ' :  PRODUCT Y BY Z ADDED TO X
  \item OP = 'X=X-YZ  ' :  PRODUCT Y BY Z SUBSTRACTED FROM X
  \item OP = 'X=CXY   ' :  PRODUCT OF C X AND Y COPIED ON TO X
  \item OP = 'X=CYZ   ' :  PRODUCT OF C, Y AND Z COPIED ON TO X
  \item OP = 'X=CXYZ  ' :  PRODUCT OF C, X, Y AND Z COPIED ON TO X
  \item OP = 'X=X+CYZ ' :  PRODUCT OF C, Y AND Z ADDED TO X
  \item OP = 'X=Y/Z   ' :  DIVISION OF Y BY Z COPIED ON TO X
  \item OP = 'X=CY/Z  ' :  PRODUCT OF C BY Y DIVIDED BY Z ET COPIED ONTO X
  \item OP = 'X=CXY/Z ' :  PRODUCT C X Y DIVIDED BY Z AND COPIED ON X
  \item OP = 'X=X+CY/Z' :  PRODUCT OF C BY Y DIVIDED BY Z ADDED TO X
  \item OP = 'X=X+Y   ' :  Y ADDED TO X
  \item OP = 'X=X-Y   ' :  Y SUBSTRACTED FROM X
  \item OP = 'X=CX    ' :  X MULTIPLIED BY C
  \item OP = 'X=CY    ' :  CY COPIED ON TO X
  \item OP = 'X=Y+CZ  ' :  CZ ADDED TO Y AND COPIED ON TO X
  \item OP = 'X=X+CY  ' :  CY ADDED TO X
  \item OP = 'X=SQR(Y)' :  SQUARE ROOT OF Y COPIED ON TO X
  \item OP = 'X=ABS(Y)' :  ABSOLUTE VALUE OF Y COPIED ON TO X
  \item OP = 'X=N(Y,Z)' :  X NORM OF THE VECTOR WITH COMPONENTS Y,Z
  \item OP = 'X=Y+C   ' :  C ADDED TO Y COPIED ON TO X
  \item OP = 'X=X+C   ' :  C ADDED TO X
  \item OP = 'X=Y**C  ' :  Y AT THE POWER OF C COPIED ON TO X
  \item OP = 'X=COS(Y)' :  COSINE OF Y COPIED ON TO X
  \item OP = 'X=SIN(Y)' :  SINE OF Y COPIED ON TO X
  \item OP = 'X=ATN(Y)' :  ARCTG OF Y COPIED ON TO X
  \item OP = 'X=A(Y,Z)' :  INVERSE OF TANGENT Y/Z COPIED ON TO X
  \item OP = 'X=+(Y,C)' :  X = MAX OF Y AND C
  \item OP = 'X=-(Y,C)' :  X = MIN OF Y AND C
  \item OP = 'X=+(Y,Z)' :  X = MAX OF Y AND Z
  \item OP = 'X=-(Y,Z)' :  X = MIN OF Y AND Z
  \item OP = 'X=YIFZ$<$C' :  FOR EACH POINT : X = Y IF Z $<$ C
  \item OP = 'X=C(Y-Z)' :  X = C*(Y-Z)
\end{itemize}

Examples:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
CALL OS(`X=0     `,X=TAB)
\end{lstlisting}
will set the double precision array of BIEF\_OBJ structure TAB to zero.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
CALL OS(`X=Y+Z   `,X=TRAV1,Y=U,Z=V)
\end{lstlisting}
will copy the sum of U and V on to TRAV1.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
CALL OS(`X=Y+Z   `,TRAV1,U,V)
\end{lstlisting}
will have the same effect. As all the arguments are present up to Z, there is
no ambiguity.

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE OV(OP,X,Y,Z,C,NPOIN)
\end{lstlisting}

OV carries out the same operations as OS (it is called by OS), but directly on
double precision arrays and without consistency checks or structure updating.
The argument NPOIN indicates the number of values on which the operation must
be conducted.

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE OV_2(OP,X,IX,Y,IY,Z,IZ,C,NPOIN)
\end{lstlisting}

\telkey{OV\_2} carries out the same operations as OV, but it is possible to choose the
vector dimension concerned by the operation. These dimension numbers are
indicated by IX, IY and IZ.

The instruction:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
CALL OV_2(OP,X,2,Y,5,Z,3,C,NPOIN)
\end{lstlisting}
thus replaces the former instruction:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
CALL OV(OP,X(1,2),Y(1,5),Z(1,3),C,NPOIN)
\end{lstlisting}

where X, Y and Z were declared as two-dimensional arrays.

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE OVD(OP,X,Y,Z,C,IOPT,INFINI,ZERO,NPOIN)
\end{lstlisting}

\telkey{OVD} carries out the same operations as OS (it is called by OS), but directly on
double precision arrays and without consistency checks or structure updating.
The argument NPOIN indicates the number of values on which the operation must
be conducted.

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE OVD_2(OP,X,DIMX,Y,DIMY,Z,DIMZ,C,DIM1,NPOIN,IOPT,INFINI,ZERO)
\end{lstlisting}

\telkey{OVD\_2} is comparable to OVD but acts on 2-dimensional vectors, the
second size being DIM1. \telkey{OVD\_2} will actually call \telkey{OVD} with
X(1,DIMX), Y(1,DIMY) and Z(1,DIMZ) as arguments instead of X, Y and Z.

\begin{description}
  \item [DIM1] is the first dimension of vectors X, Y and Z.
\end{description}

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE OSBD(OP,X,Y,Z,C,MESH)}
\end{lstlisting}

The form and the principle are the same as for OS but the array MESH (mesh
structure) is given as a last argument. In this case we have vectors which
would be refused by OS because of lack of consistency. For \telkey{OSBD}, X is defined
on the boundaries and Y and Z are vectors defined on the whole domain. There is
thus data retrieval of Y and Z, which requires the presence of MESH.

The possible operations are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item OP = 'X=Y     ':  BOUNDARY VALUES OF Y COPIED ON TO X
  \item OP = 'X=+Y    ':  IDEM
  \item OP = 'X=X+Y   ':  BOUNDARY VALUES OF Y ADDED TO X
  \item OP = 'X=Y+Z   ':  BOUNDARY VALUES OF Y AND Z ADDED TO X
  \item OP = 'X=X-Y   ':  BOUNDARY VALUES OF Y SUBSTRACTED TO X
  \item OP = 'X=CY    ':  BOUNDARY VALUES OF CY COPIED ON TO X
  \item OP = 'X=X+CY  ':  BOUNDARY VALUES OF CY ADDED TO X
  \item OP = 'X=CXY   ':  BOUNDARY VALUES OF CXY COPIED ON TO X
\end{itemize}

All the arguments are mandatory.

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE OVBD(OP,X,Y,Z,C,NBOR,NPTFR)
\end{lstlisting}

Same role as \telkey{OSBD} but by giving the general numbering of the boundary points
and the number of boundary points. \telkey{OVBD} does not conduct any check.

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE OSDB(OP,X,Y,Z,C,MESH)
\end{lstlisting}

Same principle as for \telkey{OSBD}. Here, X is defined on the entire domain and Y and Z
are vectors defined on the boundaries. Only the X values corresponding to
boundary points are filled.

The following operations are possible:
\begin{itemize}
  \item OP = 'X=Y     ' : Y COPIED ON TO X
  \item OP = 'X=+Y    ' : IDEM
  \item OP = 'X=X+Y   ' : Y ADDED TO X
  \item OP = 'X=X-Y   ' : Y SUBSTRACTED FROM X
  \item OP = 'X=CY    ' : CY COPIED ON TO X
  \item OP = 'X=Y+Z   ' : Y+Z COPIED ON TO X
  \item OP = 'X=X-YZ  ' : YZ SUBSTRACTED FROM X
  \item OP = 'X=X+CY  ' : CY ADDED TO X
  \item OP = 'X=XY    ' : X MULTIPLIED BY Y
\end{itemize}

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE OSDBIF(OP,X,Y,Z,C,INDIC,CRITER,MESH)
\end{lstlisting}

Same principle as for \telkey{OSDB} but a test is done. If INDIC(K)=CRITER, the
operation OP is done on index number K of vector X.

The following operations are possible:
\begin{itemize}
  \item OP = 'X=Y     ' : Y COPIED ON TO X
  \item OP = 'X=+Y    ' : IDEM
\end{itemize}

\begin{description}
\item [INDIC] is an integer array (not a structure).
\item [CRITER] is a given integer.
\end{description}

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE OVDB(OP,X,Y,Z,C,NBOR,NPTFR)
\end{lstlisting}

Same role as \telkey{OSDB} but by giving data from MESH, the general numbering of the
boundary points and the number of boundary points. OVDB does not conduct any
check.

\subsection{Operations on matrices}

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE OM(OP,M,N,D,C,MESH)
\end{lstlisting}

\telkey{OP} is the operation to be carried out. M and N are two matrices, D a diagonal
and C a constant. N, D and C are only used when they are part of the operation.
MESH is the integer block of the mesh.

The following operations are possible:
\begin{itemize}
  \item OP = 'M=N     ' : COPY OF N ON TO M
  \item OP = 'M=TN    ' : COPY OF TRANSPOSED OF N ON TO M
  \item OP = 'M=CN    ' : PRODUCT OF N BY THE C CONSTANT
  \item OP = 'M=M+CN  ' : CN ADDED TO M
  \item OP = 'M=M+CTN ' : C TIMES TRANSPOSED OF N ADDED TO M
  \item OP = 'M=M+N   ' : N ADDED TO M
  \item OP = 'M=M+TN  ' : TRANSPOSED OF N ADDED TO M
  \item OP = 'M=MD    ' : RIGHT HAND PRODUCT OF M BY D
  \item OP = 'M=DM    ' : LEFT HAND PRODUCT OF M BY D
  \item OP = 'M=DMD   ' : LEFT AND RIGHT HAND PRODUCT OF M BY D
  \item OP = 'M=0     ' : M COMPONENTS ARE SET TO 0
  \item OP = 'M=X(M)  ' : CHANGE TO A NON SYMMETRICAL FORM
  \item OP = 'M=MSK(M)' : MASKING EXTRADIAGONAL TERMS
  \item OP = 'M=M-DN  ' : REMOVING DN FROM M
  \item OP = 'M=M-ND  ' : REMOVING ND FROM M
  \item OP = 'M=M+D   ' : Diagonal D added to M
\end{itemize}

When the operation only concerns M, it is advisable to repeat M instead of the
argument N. In all cases N should be a matrix-structure, or it may generate
inexplicable crashes.

It is possible that a few of these operations are not yet programmed with all
the matrix-storage.

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE LUMP(DIAG,A,MESH,XMUL)
\end{lstlisting}

Returns a vector representing a diagonal matrix DIAG (in fact a
\telkey{BIEF\_OBJ} structure with a vector type) containing the sum of the rows
of the matrix A.  The other arguments are given below:

\begin{description}
  \item [MESH]esh structure.
  \item [XMUL] Multiplying factor.
\end{description}

\subsection{Matrix x vector products}

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE MATVEC(OP,X,A,Y,C,MESH,[LEGO])
\end{lstlisting}

The result is the vector X (BIEF\_OBJ structure) which, depending on the
operation OP, contains different combinations of X, C and the product of A and
Y:
\begin{itemize}
  \item OP = 'X=AY    '  : X = AY
  \item OP = 'X=X+AY  '  : X = X + AY
  \item OP = 'X=X-AY  '  : X = X - AY
  \item OP = 'X=X+CAY '  : X = X + C AY
  \item OP = 'X=TAY   '  : X = TA Y (TRANSPOSED OF A)
  \item OP = 'X=X+TAY '  : X = X + TA Y
  \item OP = 'X=X-TAY '  : X = X - TA Y
  \item OP = 'X=X+CTAY'  : X = X + C TA Y
\end{itemize}

The other arguments are:
\begin{description}
  \item [MESH] Mesh integer structure.
\end{description}

Optional argument:
\begin{description}
  \item [LEGO] Logical.
\end{description}

If LEGO is equal to .FALSE., the vector X will not be assembled and part of the
result (due to the off-diagonal terms of A) will be contained in the array W of
structure MESH. The vector X will contain only the contribution of the
diagonal.

The aim of LEGO=.FALSE. is to save on assemblies during calculations where X is
the sum of several matrix x vector products.

Thus to calculate X = A Y + B Z, the following two calls will be made one after
the other:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
CALL MATVEC('X=AY    ',X,A,Y,C,MESH,LEGO=.FALSE.)
CALL MATVEC('X=X+AY  ',X,B,Z,C,MESH,LEGO=.TRUE.)
\end{lstlisting}

This will save on the assembly of the product A Y.

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE MATRBL(OP,X,A,Y,C,MESH)
\end{lstlisting}

The principle is the same as MATVEC but MATRBL applies to blocks.

If A is a block of 4 matrices. X and Y must be blocks of 2 vectors.

If A is a block of 9 matrices. X and Y must be blocks of 3 vectors.

The only operations that are possible for the moment are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item OP = 'X=AY    '  : X = AY
  \item OP = 'X=TAY   '  : X = TA Y (TRANSPOSED OF A)
\end{itemize}

\section{Solving linear systems}

The processing of a linear system is handled entirely by the subroutine SOLVE,
except for the Dirichlet-type boundary conditions processed by DIRICH (see also
\ref{ref:dirichletbnd}).

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE DIRICH( F,S,SM,FBOR,LIMDIR,WORK,MESH,KDIR,MSK,MASKPT)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{description}
  \item [F] Initial and future solution of the system
  \item [S] System matrix
  \item [SM]    Right hand side of system ("Second membre" in French)
  \item [FBOR]  Dirichlet point boundary condition
  \item [LIMDIR] Boundary conditions type if LIMDIR(K) = KDIR the $K^{th}$
    boundary point is a Dirichlet type point.
  \item [WORK] Working array block.
  \item [KDIR] Convention for Dirichlet conditions
  \item [MESH] BIEF\_MESH structure
  \item [MSK] if YES, presence of masked elements
  \item [MASKPT] Masked points array
    \begin{itemize}
      \item =1 : Normal
      \item =0 : Masked point
    \end{itemize}
\end{description}

If S is a block of 4 or 9 matrices, F must be a block of 2 or 3 vectors, LIMDIR
must be an array with 2 or 3 dimensions, and FBOR must be an array of 2 or 3
vectors.

\telkey{DIRICH} will modify the matrices and right hand sides of the system to
take into account the prescribed values.

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE SOLVE(X,A,B,TB,CFG,INFOGR,MESH,AUX)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{description}
  \item [X] Solution vector.
  \item [A] System matrix.
  \item [B] Second member of system.
  \item [TB] Block containing working arrays.
  \item [CFG] Solver configuration.
  \item [INFOGR] if .TRUE., information will be printed.
  \item [MESH] BIEF\_MESH structure.
  \item [AUX] Matrix used for preconditioning. Not used by diagonal
    preconditioning
\end{description}

Here is the meaning of options stored in the SLVCFG structure called above CFG:
\begin{description}
  \item [CFG\%SLV]
    \begin{description}
      \item [1] Conjugate gradient
      \item [2] Conjuguate residual
      \item [3] Normal equation on conjugate gradient
      \item [4] Minimal error
      \item [5] Conjugate gradient squared
      \item [6] Conjugate gradient squared stabilised
      \item [7] Gmres
    \end{description}

  \item [CFG\%KRYLOV] Only used by GMRES. The option is the dimension of
      Krylov's space (see ref. \citet{Hervouet1991}).

  \item [CFG\%PRECON] Preconditioning choice.
    \begin{description}
      \item [1] Nothing

      \item [3] Block-diagonal preconditioning
      \item [5] Diagonal preconditioning with absolute values of diagonal
      \item [7] Crout preconditioning
      \item [11] Gauss-seidel ebe preconditioning
      \item [13] Matrix given by the user
      \item [17] Specific to \telemac{3D}. Direct solution on verticals are
        used as preconditioning.
    \end{description}

      right-hand side is less than 1..

  \item [CFG\%ZERO] Epsilon for the divisions by zero.

  \item [CFG\%NITMAX] Maximum number of iterations.
\end{description}

TB will be used by \telkey{SOLVE} to find \telkey{BIEF\_OBJ} structures with
working arrays. The number of structures to be placed in TB depends on the
method chosen. At the time being, the minimum number of arrays in TB must be:

\telkey{S*MAX(7,2+2*METHOD\%KRYLOV)} where S is 1 if the system is made of 1
  matrix, 2 for blocks of 4 matrices (2 unknowns like in ARTEMIS) and 3 for
  blocks of 9 matrices (3 unknowns like in \telemac{2D}).

\section{Parallelism}

Parallelism consists of using simultaneously a cluster of computers, or a group
of processors in the same computer, to solve a single problem. Using n
processors would ideally divide by n the time necessary to solve the same
problem with only one processor. The task would be easy if the problem could be
broken down into sub-tasks, independent of each other. It becomes much more
difficult when each processor needs the results from the others. We will focus
hereafter on parallelism performed with processors having each its own memory,
and communicating with the others via message transmission, this is the case
with networks of work stations or PC's and is known as distributed-memory
parallelism.

Many experiments in automatic parallelism, where compilers themselves perform
the task of optimizing the program, showed very poor improvement in CPU time.
Furthermore, vectorization and parallelism appeared to be contradictory.
Vectorization requires simple loops to perform sub-tasks whereas
distributed-memory parallelism hands over complex tasks to each processor so as
to optimize communication time and data transmission time. Efficiently
vectorized software would be naturally poorly parallelized. As an example, the
assembly loops resulting from an EBE matrix-vector product cannot be
accelerated by more than a ratio of two even if we overlook the communication
time. This is due to the fact that the results of each processor have to be
assembled. That leads to a new cost which limits drastically the overall time
to be gained. This is known as a granularity problem, the size of the tasks to
be parallelized being too small. It is unlikely that progress in the algorithm
would help in solving this theoretical bottleneck. From that, the idea emerges
to break up the problem in another way: not by isolating small tasks but in a
kind of geographical way, by decomposing the domain of computation. This idea
of domain decomposition aims at assigning onto each processor one part of the
domain over which it would solve the fluid mechanics problem. The
implementation is quite easy in the case of explicit algorithms: each equation
is only a function of the variables related to the nodes in the immediate
vicinity, computed at the earlier time step. Each processor is then in charge
of the equations related to a group of nodes, and of the data concerning the
neighbours of these nodes, resulting from the previous time step. This is
executed merely by a partition of the domain, with an overlap of one element,
and data transmission at the end of each time step. In the case of our implicit
algorithms, and especially with linear systems solved on the whole domain, the
implementation is more complex, though possible. In fact, we can guarantee that
the results of a parallel computation will be the same as a scalar computation,
except for truncation errors because computations will not be performed in the
same order. Parallelism (initially implemented on our algorithms by Reinhard
Hinkelmann at the University of Hanover can be limited to the following
problems:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Partition of the domain,
  \item Communication between processors.
  \item Implementation of some basic algorithms: vector assembly, dot product,
    computation of normal vector and so on.
\end{itemize}
We will examine these three points hereafter.

\subsection{Partition of the domain}

In the case of finite element meshes and implicit algorithms, it is better to
partition without overlapping, edge to edge. The specifications for an
efficient domain decomposer would be the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item realizing a partition of meshes of triangles (the sub-domains of
    three-dimensional meshes of prisms will be made from sub-domains of
    triangles).
  \item partitioning the domain into blocks in order to ensure a balance
    between the processors. Because the main algorithms are made of loops over
    the elements and nodes, the partition will guarantee a balance between the
    numbers of elements, or similarly between the number of nodes within each
    sub-domain.
  \item minimizing the number of nodes shared by different sub-domains and for
    which communications between processors will be necessary.
\end{itemize}

We currently use the Metis mesh partitioner, which is available on the web
site: \url{http://www-users.cs.umm.edu/~karypis/metis}.

\subsection{Data structure specific to parallelism}

We describe here some of the data structures that will be often used in
parallelism.

Each sub-domain is assigned to a processor together with the information of a
standard domain (connectivity table IKLE, nodes coordinates and so on) but also
with additional information, to help in assembling the results over the whole
domain at the end of the computation. This information is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item an array KNOLG storing the global numbers of the nodes in
    the whole mesh. The inverse array, KNOGL, is defined within a loop:
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
    DO I=1,NPOIN
      KNOGL(KNOLG(I))=I
    ENDDO
    \end{lstlisting}
  \item an array NACHB whose dimension is (5,NPTIR), where NPTIR
    is the number of the interfacial nodes between the sub-domain and the
    others.  These interfacial nodes are numbered from 1 to NPTIR. NACHB(1,IR)
    is the global number of the interfacial node IR. This array gathers the
    information to be transmitted to the others processors. The integers
    NACHB(2,IR) to NACHB(5,IR) are the numbers of the other sub-domains which
    the nodes belong to. They may have a -1 value if these sub-domains are less
    than 4. The dimension 5 must be increased if a node belongs to more than 5
    sub-domains.
\end{itemize}
Some additional information has to be defined on the actual boundary nodes of a
2-dimensional domain:
\begin{itemize}
  \item ISEG, XSEG, YSEG and NUMLIQ.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item If ISEG $>$0: the boundary node just after belongs to another
        sub-domain, its global number is ISEG, and its real coordinates are
        XSEG and YSEG.
      \item If ISEG $<$0: the boundary node just before belongs to another
        sub-domain, its global number is -ISEG, and its real coordinates are
        XSEG and YSEG.
      \item If ISEG = -999999: the node verifies the two conditions above (this
        pathological case is not considered by the software).
    \end{itemize}
    The latest algorithms designed in Telemac replaced the use of XSEG and YSEG
    by parallel communications, thus these arrays could be removed in a near
    future.
\item the integer array NUMLIQ is a specific numbering of the liquid
  boundaries, which allows association of boundary conditions to them, e.g. an
  imposed discharge. A numbering is easy to define when the whole domain is
  known. A possible convention is to start the numbering of these liquid
  boundaries (inflow and outflow) from the extreme south-west node of the
  domain and proceeding in the anti clock-wise way along the edge. In the case
  of a sub-domain for which it is not possible to go over the whole contour,
  the numbering must be specified because it cannot be simply recomputed.

\item IFAPAR is used by the method of characteristics to compute the
  paths or trajectories when they cross interfaces between sub-domains. The
  size is IFAPAR(6,NELEM2), as only 2-dimensional data is required.
  IFAPAR(1:3,IELEM) gives the processor numbers behind the 3 edges of a
  triangle. IFAPAR(4:6,IELEM) gives, for the same edges, the local number in
  its processor of the element behind the edge.

\item an array INDPU, inverse of NACHB(1,*) helps storing the data
  received from the other processors: INDPU(NACHB(1,I))=I. Given the number of
  an interfacial node, INDPU sends back its global number within the
  sub-domain.

\item an array FAC, providing for each node, the inverse of the number
  of sub-domains to which it belongs (see the algorithm for dot product
  hereafter).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Communication between processors}

Programming by communicative process requires the use of a library of
communication functions, such as PVM or MPI. We currently use MPI version 2.
These libraries perform different operations:
\begin{itemize}
  \item setting up of the parallel machine, that is, organizing the
    communication between various computers or processors,
  \item running programs on all the processors (spawn order with PVM).  In some
    cases, one processor has the function of a master, the others being the
    slaves. The program is first run on the master processor, and includes a
    start order for the slaves. A group name is given to the computation. Apart
    from this initialization step, there is then no more hierarchy between the
    processors.
  \item various kinds of communication: point to point or collective.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Point to point communication}

This is the basic communication between two processors, the receptor and the
transmitter. The send function and the receive function can differ depending on
the types of data (integers, real numbers, etc.). The functions arguments are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item identifier of receptor or transmitter,
  \item address of the data to transmit or receive,
  \item a message flag.
\end{itemize}
Transmissions can be made in two ways. Synchronous transmission occurs when
waiting for the receptor to be ready; this avoids a copy in the buffer.
Asynchronous transmission occurs whatever the state of the reception.

\paragraph{Collective communication}

Collective communications use simultaneously all the processors. Three types
may be distinguished:
\begin{itemize}
  \item broadcast: a processor (generally the master) sends the same data to
    all the slaves,

  \item synchronization: refers to a barrier which all processors must reach
    before going on the computation,

  \item conditional transmission: each processor sends a data and receives in
    return the sum, the maximum or the minimum of all the data transmitted.
\end{itemize}
To make the source programs independent of the choice of the communication
functions library, it is worth writing an interface library to deal with all
the communications between the processors. In Telemac this library is called
"parallel". When there is no parallelism involved a fake library "paravoid" is
used instead, which does not contain any link to a parallelism library. Only a
few functions are necessary:
\begin{description}
  \item [P\_DMAX(X)] maximum of X over all the processors. X is a
    double-precision real.
  \item [P\_DMIN(X)] minimum of X over all the processors. X is a
    double-precision real.
  \item [P\_DSUM(X)] sum of all the values of X provided by all the processors.
    X is a double-precision real.
  \item [P\_IMAX(I)] maximum of I over all the processors. I is an integer.
  \item [P\_IMIN(I)] minimum of I over all the processors. I is an integer.
  \item [P\_ISUM(I)] sum of all the values of I provided by all the processors.
    I is an integer.
  \item [P\_MAIL(CHAINE,NCAR)] broadcasting a character string CHAINE, with a
    length NCAR, to all the processors.
  \item [P\_READ(BUFFER,NBYTES,SOURCE,TYPE)] reading of NBYTES bytes of data
    whose type is TYPE, to be stored at the address BUFFER and sent by the
    processor SOURCE.
  \item [P\_SYNC] stops the processors till all of them call this function.
  \item [P\_WRIT(BUFFER,NBYTES,DEST,TYPE)] writing of NBYTES bytes of data,
    whose type is TYPE, located at the address BUFFER and intended for the
    processor DEST.
\end{description}

\subsection{Adaptation of the algorithms}

\paragraph{Dot product}

The dot product of two vectors over the whole domain implies local computing
first, then summing up over the whole sub-domains. While summing, the interface
nodes are taken into account several times. The array FAC is then used to
correct this error. The parallel dot product \telkey{P\_DOT} of the vectors X
and Y is written as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
P_DOT = 0.D0
DO I=1,NPOIN
  P_DOT=P_DOT+X(I)*Y(I)*FAC(I)
ENDDO
P_DOT=P_DSUM(P_DOT)
\end{lstlisting}

On a vector computer, multiplying by FAC(I) does not affect the time of
computation. On the contrary, the call to the \telkey{P\_SUM} routine causes a
synchronization of the processors.

\paragraph{Matrix x vector product}

First, building the matrices and computing the product are done locally,
independently of the other sub-domains. The result is a vector without any
contribution from the neighbour sub-domains, on the interfacial nodes. The
missing contributions result from the computation of the vector on the other
sub-domains. For example, if the node I belongs to two different sub-domains,
for which we get X(I)=3 and X(I)=5 respectively, the actual value of X(I) would
be the sum 3+5. This can be achieved if processor 1 sends the value 3 to
processor 2 and processor 2 sends the value 5 to processor 1. Although it
appears simple, this operation is quite complex to achieve because it can lead
to a fatal risk: both processors waiting endlessly for the contribution of the
other before sending their own. We describe hereafter the series of operations
required, known as ``blocking communication''. More recently, a non-blocking
communication scheme has been implemented by Pascal Vezolles from IBM Europe.
Basically this second approach consists of providing MPI with the list of
communications to perform, and MPI internal routines will organize the work
with their own algorithms.

Communication of data after a matrix-vector product:

Up to version 5.8:

Generally speaking we have a number of processors which much send or receive
information to or from the others. The main difficulty is to avoid blocked
situations where two processors would wait to receive information from each
other before sending their own, hence the definition of higher rank and lower
rank processors. We have kept the explanations on this obsolete implementation
because it really tackles the problem, while the new implementation from
version 5.9 on only uses the capabilities of the MPI language, namely the non
blocking communication with subroutines \telkey{MPI\_IRECV} and
\telkey{MPI\_ISEND}.

The transmission is split into 4 different tasks, depending on the rank of the processors:
\begin{itemize}
  \item transmission of the data to the higher rank processors.
  \item reception by the higher rank processors.
  \item transmission of the data to the lower rank processors.
  \item reception by the lower rank processors.
\end{itemize}

New data are required for every processor. Each processor prepares its own
numbering of higher rank and lower rank processors as well as a numbering of
nodes interfacing with each of these processors. 4 new arrays IKP, NHP, IKM and
NHM are necessary to navigate from one numbering to another:
\begin{itemize}
  \item IKP(NBMAXDSHARE,2): IKP(IZH,1) refers to the processor which is the
    $IZH^{th} $ local higher rank processor. IKP(IZH,2) is the number of
    interfacial nodes shared with this processor. NBMAXDSHARE is defined in
    BIEF\_DEF where it is set to 80. It is the maximum number of sub-domains
    neighbouring a given sub-domain.
  \item IKM(NBMAXDSHARE,2): IKM(IZH,1) refers to the processor which is the
    $IZH^{th} $ local lower rank processor. IKM(IZH,2) is the number of
    interfacial nodes shared with this processor.
  \item NHP(NBMAXDSHARE,NPTIR): NHP(IZH,IR) is the global number in the
    sub-domain of a point whose number is IR in the interface with the$IZH^{th}
    $ higher rank processor.
  \item NHM(NBMAXDSHARE,NPTIR): NHM(IZH,IR) is the global number in the
    sub-domain of a point whose number is IR in the interface with the$IZH^{th}
    $ lower rank processor.
  \item ILMAX is the maximum distance in order between the processor and its
    neighbours. It will restrict the size of the loops over these neighbours.
\end{itemize}
Considering this information, the data transmission for vector V (defined over
the whole domain) and for processor IPID, is written as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item storage of the data to be sent in a first buffer
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
DO I=1,NPTIR
  BUF(I)=V(NACHB(1,I))
ENDDO
  \end{lstlisting}

  \item transmission to higher rank processors, for example processor ILP
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item storage of the data relative to the processor in a second buffer

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
DO I=1,IKP(ILP,2)
  ERGBUF(I)=BUF(INDPU(NHP(ILP,I)))
ENDDO
    \end{lstlisting}

    \item sending
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
CALL P_WRIT(ERGBUF,8*IKP(ILP,2),IKP(ILP,1),
            ABS(IKP(ILP,1)-IPID)
    \end{lstlisting}
  \end{enumerate}
  \item reception from lower rank processors, for example processor ILM
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item reception
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
CALL P_READ(ERGBUF,8*IKM(ILM,2),IKM(ILM,1),
            ABS(IKM(ILM,1)-IPID)
    \end{lstlisting}

    \item storage in vector V
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
DO I=1,IKM(ILM,2)
  V(NHM(ILM,I))=V(NHM(ILM,I))+ERGBUF(I)
ENDDO
    \end{lstlisting}
  \end{enumerate}

  \item transmission to lower rank processors, for example processor ILM

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item storage of the data relative to the processor in a second buffer

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
DO I=1,IKM(ILM,2)
  ERGBUF(I)=BUF(INDPU(NHM(ILM,I)))
ENDDO
    \end{lstlisting}

    \item sending

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
CALL P_WRIT(ERGBUF,8*IKM(ILM,2),IKM(ILM,1),
            ABS(IKM(ILM,1)-IPID)
    \end{lstlisting}

  \end{enumerate}
  \item reception from upper rank processors, for example processor ILP
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item reception

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
CALL P_READ(ERGBUF,8*IKP(ILP,2), IKP(ILP,1),
            ABS(IKP(ILP,1)-IPID)
    \end{lstlisting}

    \item summing into vector V

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
DO I=1,IKP(ILP,2)
  V(NHP(ILP,I))=V(NHP(ILP,I))+ERGBUF(I)
ENDDO
    \end{lstlisting}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

This algorithm can be made more complex to process several vectors at the same
time or for tasks different from summing.

From version 5.9 on:

The implementation is much easier with the MPI subroutines \telkey{MPI\_IRECV}
and \telkey{MPI\_ISEND} (see subroutine PARACO). Only lists of processors are
necessary, regardless of any order in the communications, the rest is handled
by MPI. To achieve this, a number of new data have been added to the
\telkey{BIEF\_MESH} structure. They are listed below. Moreover in version 5.9
parallel communication data linked to segments have been added, which doubles
the necessary data.
\begin{description}
  \item [NB\_NEIGHB] number of neighbouring processors (seen by points).
  \item [NB\_NEIGHB\_SEG] number of neighbouring processors (seen by segments).
  \item [NB\_NEIGHB\_PT] number of points shared with processors (array of size
    NB\_NEIGHB).
  \item [NB\_NEIGHB\_PT\_SEG] number of segments shared with processor I (array
    of size NB\_NEIGHB\_SEG).
  \item [LIST\_SEND] list of neighbouring processors to which data must be sent
    (seen by points).
  \item [LIST\_SEND\_SEG] list of neighbouring processors to which data must be
    sent (seen by segments).
\end{description}
There should be also accordingly a LIST\_RECEIVE, but it is actually exactly
like LIST\_SEND, so it has not been created.
\begin{description}
  \item [NH\_COM] array of size (DIM1\_NHCOM,NB\_NEIGHB). DIM1\_NHCOM is at
    least the maximum number of points that can be shared with a single
    processor. It can be slightly more for optimisation (see subroutine
    PARINI). NH\_COM(I,J) is the global number in the sub-domain of the
    $I^{th}$ point shared with the $J^{th}$ neighbouring processor.
  \item [NH\_COM\_SEG] like NH\_COM but for segments.
  \item [BUF\_SEND] buffer of memory that will be used by MPI subroutines.
  \item [BUF\_RECV] buffer of memory that will be used by MPI subroutines.
\end{description}

\paragraph{Specific cases}

It is worth noting that just a few alterations of the scalar and matrix-vector
products are sufficient to solve a linear equation with partial derivative in
shared memory. Furthermore, the contributions of the interfacial terms can be
postponed until the final solving. They would be necessary before only if real
nodal values, dot product, matrix-vector product or final results are needed.
For a linear equation, these operations can be confined in the resolution of
the linear system. Once the tools have been set up to communicate between
processors, parallelization of fluid mechanics software is quite easy. However,
specific cases, arising mainly from non-linearity have to be considered. The
basic idea is to get identical results on vector or parallel computers, except
for truncation errors. Some examples follow:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Diagonal preconditioning: the diagonal used for preconditioning has to
    be completed at the interfaces.
  \item Computation of nodal values after projection onto a basis: let us
    consider the gradient of a function $f$. A mean nodal value of
    $\overrightarrow{grad} (f)$  is given by:
    \[\overrightarrow{grad} (f)_{i} =
      \frac{\mathop{\smallint}\nolimits_{\Omega } \overrightarrow{grad} (f)\Psi _{i}
d\Omega }{\mathop{\smallint }\nolimits_{\Omega } \Psi _{i}  d\Omega } \]
issued from the mean-value theorem. In this case the computation of the general
term  $\mathop{\smallint }\nolimits_{\Omega } \Psi _{i}  d\Omega $  has to be
completed at the interfaces. The vector including: $\mathop{\smallint
}\nolimits_{\Omega } \overrightarrow{grad} (f)\Psi _{i}
d\Omega $ is unchanged when added to the right-hand side of a linear system
(the solver itself will complete this term). However it must be completed when
used to compute another term such as a turbulent production.
  \item any global concept: maximum Courant number, maximum Froude number,
    etc., have to be transmitted between processors.

  \item the method of characteristics: for high values of the Courant number, a
    characteristic curve may leave a sub-domain and enter others. Programming
    this situation within the parallel architecture requires a huge number of
    random transmissions, depending on the flow. The implementation of this
    technique in parallel has been achieved by Jacek Jankowski from
    BundesAnstalt f\"{u}r Wasserbau in Germany.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Basic subroutines}

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE BIEF\_CLOSE\_FILES(CODE,FILES,NFILES,PEXIT
\end{lstlisting}

Replaces the old \telkey{CLOSE\_FILES} or \telkey{CLOSE\_FILES2}

\underbar{arguments}:
\begin{description}
  \item [CODE] is a 20 characters string saying which programme calls the
    subroutine, for example 'ARTEMIS'.
  \item [FILES] is an array of \telkey{BIEF\_FILE} structures containing a
    description of all files used by the program.
  \item [NFILES] is the number of files (and dimension of FILES)
  \item [PEXIT] is a logical value. If yes, the call to the subroutine will
    also trigger an exit from MPI.
\end{description}

All the relevant files, whose names are known through the DECLARATIONS\_TELEMAC
module, are closed by this subroutine.

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE CLIP(VEC,XMIN,CLPMIN,XMAX,CLPMAX,NPOIN)
\end{lstlisting}

\underbar{arguments}:
\begin{description}
  \item [CLIP] clips an array of real values:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Lower values limited by XMIN if the logic CLPMIN is true.
      \item Upper values limited by XMAX if the logic CLPMAX is true.
    \end{itemize}
  \item [CLIP] can handle vector structures as well as conventional FORTRAN
    arrays.
  \item [NPOIN] For a conventional array, NPOIN is taken as a dimension of the
    array.
  \item [VEC] must be a BIEF\_OBJ structure of vector type:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item If NPOIN = 0, the dimension given by the structure is taken.
      \item If NPOIN$<$0, the dimension -NPOIN is imposed. This must then be
        less than or equal to the real dimension.
    \end{itemize}
\end{description}

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE FILTER( VEC,BLDMAT,T1,T2,A,FORMUL,XMUL,F,G,H,U,V,W,MESH,MSK,MASKEL,N)
\end{lstlisting}

Filtering operation of the vector VEC. T1 and T2 are working BIEF\_OBJ
structures. From XMUL, the arguments are the same as those of MATRIX. A is a
matrix which is either given (if the logical value BLDMAT is false), or
constructed according to the formula FORMUL (if BLDMAT is true). In the latter
case, the arguments F, G, H, U, V, W, may be used if they appear in the formula
FORMUL.

VEC is modified \textbf{N times} by FILTER according to the following formula:
$new VEC = XMUL*\frac{A*VEC}{A^{L}}$
where $A^{L}$ is the diagonal matrix obtained by mass-lumping A, that is by
totalling the terms in each row.

If A is a mass matrix (FORMUL = 'MATMAS          '), a smoothed vector VEC is
obtained, with its integral in the domain (the 'mass') preserved.

If FORMUL = 'FMATMA          ', a smoothed vector VEC is obtained, with
preservation of the integral of the function F VEC.

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE BIEF_OPEN_FILES(CODE,FILES,NFILES,PATH,FLOT,IFLOT,ICODE)
\end{lstlisting}

Replaces the old \telkey{OPEN\_FILES}, to enable coupled programs to run concurrently
even if they use the same logical units.

The first three arguments are like \telkey{BIEF\_CLOSE\_FILES}.

PATH is the full name of the path leading to the directory containing the files
(or at least the parameter file).

FLOT is a logical value stating if there is code coupling. In this case the
logical units of every file are dynamically computed and will start at IFLOT+1,
IFLOT being the argument after FLOT.

IFLOT: see explanations on FLOT above.

ICODE is the code number in case of coupling (the calling program will be code 1, the called program will be code 2).

The basic data for opening the files is stored in the dictionary of each
program, namely in the key-word called SUBMIT. Here is the example for the
geometry file in \telemac{2D}:

SUBMIT : 'NGEO-READ;T2DGEO;OBLIG;BIN;LIT;SELAFIN-GEOM'

NGEO is no longer used.

READ means that this file will be opened in only read mode.

T2DGEO will be the name of the file in the temporary directory where the case
will be run. T2DGEO is also declared in \telemac{2D} as an integer which is the
file number. It will be 1 and will not float in case of code coupling.

OBLIG means that the file is mandatory

BIN means that it is a binary file

LIT is a message for parallelism that the file will be read by every processor
and must thus be copied for every of them. ECR would mean that it is a result
that must be given back with an extension indicating the processor number.

SELAFIN-GEOM indicates that the file is at the SELAFIN format and GEOM says
that it must be taken as the geometry file for domain decomposition. Other
possibilities are : CAS (steering file), DICO (dictionary), CONLIM (boundary
conditions to be taken into account in domain decomposition).

All the possibilities are documented in the dictionaries of parallelised
programs.

The last argument ICODE is the program number in case of coupling. So far some
data in \bief library are concurrently used by coupled programs, hence \bief
must now which program is running, this is done by using: \telkey{CALL
CONFIG\_CODE(ICODE)} when shifting to another program in code coupling,
\telkey{CONFIG\_CODE} will thus avoid conflicts between files.

Note : the parameter file and the dictionary have prescribed names and are not
opened by \telkey{BIEF\_OPEN\_FILES}. For example, in \telemac{2D} they are
opened and closed in subroutine LECDON\_TELEMAC2D.

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE PARCOM(X,ICOM,MESH)
\end{lstlisting}

PARCOM completes the matrix-vector product in parallelism, by adding to a
vector X contributions from elements that are in other sub-domains.

\underbar{Arguments}:
\begin{description}
  \item [X] is a BIEF\_OBJ structure of a vector or a block of vectors.
  \item [ICOM] is an option.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item ICOM = 1:  the contribution with maximum absolute value is taken.
      \item ICOM = 2:  the sum of contributions is taken (the most widely used option).
      \item ICOM = 3: the maximum value is taken.
      \item ICOM = 4: the minimum value is taken.
    \end{itemize}
  \item [MESH] is the BIEF\_MESH structure of the mesh.
\end{description}

This subroutine is able to work in 2D and 3D as well. Blocks of vectors are
also treated. In 2D it will also cope with quadratic discretisation, which
implies not only a communication of points, but also of segments. PARCOM calls
a subroutine \telkey{PARCOM2} and a subroutine \telkey{PARCOM2\_SEG} which act
directly on real vectors. The call to PARCOM may be bypassed in specific cases,
e.g. when a parallel communication of segments is required.

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE PARMOY(X,MESH)
\end{lstlisting}

\telkey{PARMOY} is used in parallelism to give the mean value of a vector X at
the interface between 2 sub-domains. MESH is the \telkey{BIEF\_MESH} structure
of the mesh.

\subsection{Subroutines dealing with the selafin format file}
\begin{WarningBlock}
  This section is obsolete since v7p1 due to the introduction of hermes See
  Chapter \ref{ref:hermes} for information on Hermes.
\end{WarningBlock}
The SELAFIN format is used in 2D and 3D for the results files and for the
geometry files. It is given in appendix 3. Several routines are offered for
writing or reading such files. Others remain internal routines in \bief and will
be called directly either by ALMESH or INBIEF.

  \item [VARCLA] is another array of 32 characters strings used for the
    so-called clandestine variables in \telemac{2D}, i.e. variables which are
    in the geometry file and are merely transmitted to the results file.
  \item [NVARCL] is the number of clandestine variables.
  \item [TITRE] is the title of the file or the study (80 characters).
  \item [SORLEO] is an array of logical values saying which variables in the
    list TEXTE will be put in the file.
  \item [NSOR] is the size of SORLEO
  \item [IKLE], NELEM, NPTFR, NDP are the classical components of BIEF\_MESH
    structures : connectivity table, number of elements, number of boundary
    points and number of points per element.
  \item [DATE] and TIME are two arrays of 3 integers giving the year, month,
    day and hour, minute, second
  \item [NCSIZE] is the number of processors.
  \item [NPTIR] is the number of interface points with other sub-domains (if NCSIZE greater than 1).
  \item [KNOLG] is the global number of points in the original mesh (if NCSIZE greater than 1).
\end{description}

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE FILPOL(F,C,XSOM,YSOM,NSOM,MESH)
\end{lstlisting}

\underbar{arguments}:
\begin{description}
  \item [FILPOL] fills a vector F with a constant C, but only for points of F
    which are in a given polynomial in the computational domain.
  \item [F] is a BIEF\_OBJ structure of a vector.
  \item [C] is the constant.

    coordinates of the apices of the polynomial.
  \item [NSOM] is the number of apices (e.g. 3 for a triangle).
  \item [MESH] is the BIEF\_MESH structure of the mesh.
\end{description}

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE FIND\_IN\_SEL(RES,NAME,NFIC,W,OK)
\end{lstlisting}

FIND\_IN\_SEL will find in a SELAFIN format file a variable with a given name.

\underbar{arguments}:
\begin{description}
  \item [RES] is a BIEF\_OBJ structure to put the result in.
  \item [NAME] is the name of the variable (16 characters).
  \item [NFIC] is the logical unit of the file
  \item [W] is a working real (real, not double precision) array of size the number of points in the mesh.
  \item [OK] is a logical value saying if the variable has been found.
\end{description}

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE FONSTR( H,ZF,Z,CHESTR,NGEO,NFON,NOMFON,MESH,FFON,LISTIN)
\end{lstlisting}

FONSTR can find the bottom topography and the bottom friction in a geometry
file in the SELAFIN format. In this file the bottom topography must be called
FOND or BOTTOM, the friction must be called FROTTEMENT or BOTTOM FRICTION. If
the bottom is not in the file, another possibility is that the bottom is
computed as a function of the free surface and the depth. In this case they
must be called respectively SURFACE LIBRE or FREE SURFACE and HAUTEUR D'EAU or
WATER DEPTH. The bottom can also be given as a cluster of bathymetry points in
a specific file. These data will then be interpolated to give nodal values. The
format of bathymetry points is the following: every line is dedicated to 1
point with  X Y Z  in free format. Xand Y are the coordinates and Z is the
bottom elevation.

Lines beginning with C or B are ignored. With such a standard, SINUSX files can
be read.

If the bottom friction is not in the geometry file, CHESTR is set to the value
FFON.

The arguments of FONSTR are:
\begin{description}
  \item [H,ZF,Z] are BIEF\_OBJ structures where the depth (if any), the bottom,
    and the free surface (if present) will be stored.
  \item [CHESTR] is the BIEF\_OBJ structure for the friction coefficient.
  \item [NGEO] is the logical unit of the geometry file.
  \item [NFON] is the logical unit of the bottom file.
  \item [NOMFON] is the name of the bottom file.
  \item [MESH] is the BIEF\_MESH structure of the mesh.
  \item [FFON] is the friction coefficient if it is constant.
  \item [LISTIN] is a logical value. If yes, information will be printed.
\end{description}

The bottom friction can then be changed with the user subroutine STRCHE.

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE LITENR(VARSOR,CLAND,NPRE,STD,HIST,NHIST,NPOIN,
                  AT, TEXTPR, TEXTLU, NVAR, VARCLA, NVARCL,
                  TROUVE, ALIRE, W, LISTIN, MAXVAR)
\end{lstlisting}

LITENR will read a time record in a selafin file. It assumes that the heading
with geometry data has been read, and that a number of time records may also
have been read. Some variables of the next time record are read by LITENR. As
in ECRGEO, the name of variables is in TEXTPR, but in this list, only the
variables given by the logical array ALIRE will be read. The result will be put
in a block called VARSOR. If there are clandestine variables (their number is
NVARCL), their name is given in VARCL and they will be put into the block
CLAND. Other arguments are:
\begin{description}
  \item [NPRE] logical unit of the file.
  \item [STD] binary standard of the file (3 characters STD, IBM or I3E).
    Obsolescent, use 'STD'.
  \item [HIST] sometimes an array of real values may be put after the time in
    the same record.
  \item [NHIST] size of NHIST. So far 0 because it is not implemented in
    RUBENS.
  \item [NPOIN] number of points in the mesh.
  \item [AT] time of the record read by LITENR.
  \item [TEXTLU] is a working array of character*32 strings to store the names
    of variables in the file.
  \item [NVAR] is the number of normal variables
  \item [TROUVE] is an integer array saying if the variables asked have been
    found.
  \item [W :]s a working real (real, not double precision) array of size the
    number of points in the mesh.
  \item [LISTIN] is a logical saying if information on what is read must be
    printed.
\end{description}

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE SKIPGEO(NFIC,TITFIC,NPOIN,NVAR,TEXTLU
\end{lstlisting}

SKIPGEO reads a SELAFIN file with logical unit NFIC up the time records. It
returns the title of the file: TITFIC, the number of points in the mesh: NPOIN,
the number of variables stored: NVAR, and their names and units: TEXTLU (an
array of CHARACTER*32 strings).

\subsection{Subroutines dealing with all formats}

From version 6.2 on several formats are accepted for inputs and outputs and new
subroutines have been created to deal with this new feature. For example the
equivalent of the former \telkey{ECRGEO} with be a sequence of a call to
\telkey{CREATE\_DATASET} and a call to \telkey{WRITE\_MESH}. Writing a record
of results will be done with \telkey{BIEF\_DESIMP} (which also prints on the
listing) or \telkey{WRITE\_DATA}.

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE BIEF_DESIMP( FORMAT_RES, VARSOR, HIST, NHIST,
                       N, NRES, STD, AT, LT, LISPRD, LEOPRD,
                       SORLEO, SORIMP, MAXVAR, NOMVAR, PTINIG, PTINIL )
\end{lstlisting}

\underbar{arguments}:
\begin{description}
  \item [FORMAT\_RES] is the file format (`SELAFIN `, `SELAFIND' or `MED     `)
  \item [VARSOR] is a block containing BIEF\_OBJ structures with the variables
    to be printed in the file.
  \item [HIST] and NHIST are used to add data in the time record of the Selafin
    format (HIST will be the array of the values and NHIST their number)
  \item [N] is the number of points to be printed (it may be different from the
    number of degrees of freedom, as some values are dropped when quasi-bubble
    or quadratic elements are used).
  \item [NRES] is the logical unit of the file.
  \item [STD] is a 3-character string (meant for binary variants, currently not
    used)
  \item [AT] is the current time.
  \item [LT] is the iteration number.
  \item [LISPRD] and LEOPRD are the printing periods on listing and file.
  \item [SORLEO] and SORIMP are logical arrays stating if a variable must be
    exited or not (same order as in the block VARSOR).
  \item [MAXVAR] is the number of variables in the block VARSOR, and the
    dimension of SORLEO and SORIMP.
  \item [NOMVAR] is an array of 32-character strings containing the names (16
    characters) and units (16 characters) of variables.
  \item [PTINIG] and PTINIL are the time steps (respectively for file and
    listing) at which will start the prints. These integers stem from key-words
    such as \telkey{NUMBER OF FIRST TIME-STEP FOR GRAPHIC PRINTOUTS} in
    \telemac{2D} and \telemac{3D}.
\end{description}

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE BIEF_SUITE(VARSOR, CLAND, NUMDE, NPRE, STD,
                      HIST, NHIST, NPOIN, AT, TEXTPR,
                      VARCLA, NVARCL, TROUVE, ALIRE,
                      LISTIN, FIN, MAXVAR, NPLAN, DT)
\end{lstlisting}

\telkey{BIEF\_SUITE} is used to start a new computation from previous results.
The time record to start with is the last one if FIN=.TRUE., and is NUMDEB if
FIN=.FALSE. Otherwise the principle and arguments are the same as LITENR, see
above. For Selafin format \telkey{BIEF\_SUITE} is a combination of SKIPGEO and
LITENR.

NPLAN and DT are optional parameters.

If NPLAN is present (case of \telemac{3D} with prisms) and if the number of
planes is different, the data will be interpolated to cope with the number of
planes asked, i.e. NPLAN.

If DT is present, the time step of records in the file will be returned. This
assumes that there are at least 2 records in the file, otherwise an error
message will be issued.

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE BIEF_VALIDA(VARREF, TEXTREF, UREF, REFFORMAT, VARRES,
                       TEXTRES, URES, RESFORMAT, MAXTAB, NP, IT,
                       MAXIT, ACOMPARER)
\end{lstlisting}

BIEF\_VALIDA offers an automatic way to compare two SELAFIN files to perform
validations of modifications in a program. A reference file (logical unit UREF)
is compared to a result file (logical unit URES).

VARREF and VARRES are blocks where the variables to read will be put.

TEXTREF and TEXTRES are the names of the variables and give their implicit
numbering.

UREF and URES are the logical units of reference file and result file.

REFFORMAT and RESFORMAT are the formats of reference file and result file (i.e.
'SELAFIN ','SELAFIND' or 'MED     '.

MAXTAB is the maximum number of variables.

NP the number of points in the mesh.

IT and MAXIT are respectively the current and the maximum iteration. A
comparison is done only when the last iteration MAXIT is reached and only the
last time-step is checked.

ACOMPARER is an integer array saying if a variable must be checked
(1) or not (0).

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE CREATE_DATASET(FORMAT,NRES,TITLE,MAXVAR,NOMVAR,OUTVAR)
\end{lstlisting}

FORMAT: a 8-character string. Possible values are 'SELAFIN ', 'SELAFIND' and
'MED     '. SELAFIN is the classical format in the Telemac system. SELAFIND is
the same but with real numbers saved in double precision (so far not supported
by post processors). MED is an EDF format that is recognised by all tools of
the Salome platform.

NRES: the logical unit

In \telemac{2D} for example and for the results file, these first two arguments
will be:\\
T2D\_FILES(T2DRES)\%FMT and T2D\_FILES(T2DRES)\%LU.

TITLE is the title of the case, in 80 characters.

MAXVAR is the maximum number

This subroutine will only store in the file the information of the title and
the names and units of variables.

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE WRITE\_DATA(FORMAT_RES, NRES, MAXVAR, AT,
                       LT, SORLEO, NOMVAR, VARSOR, N)
\end{lstlisting}

Mostly as BIEF\_DESIMP, but a lower level. It will not deal with periods and
printing on listing.
\underbar{arguments}:
\begin{description}
  \item [FORMAT\_RES] is the file format (`SELAFIN `, `SELAFIND' or `MED     `)
  \item [NRES] is the logical unit of the file.
  \item [MAXVAR] is the number of variables in the block VARSOR and NOMVAR.
  \item [AT] is the current time, LT is the iteration number.
  \item [SORLEO] is a logical array stating if a variable must be exited or
    not.
  \item [NOMVAR] is an array of 32-character strings containing the names (16
    characters) and units (16 characters) of variables.
  \item [VARSOR] is a block containing BIEF\_OBJ structures with the variables
    to be printed in the file.
  \item [N] is the number of points to be printed.
\end{description}

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE WRITE_MESH(FORMAT, NRES, MESH, NPLAN, MARDAT,
                      MARTIM, I_ORIG, J_ORIG)
\end{lstlisting}

\underbar{arguments}:
\begin{description}
  \item [FORMAT and NRES] are like in subroutine \telkey{CREATE\_DATASET}
    above.
  \item [MESH] is the BIEF\_MESH structure of the mesh.
  \item [NPLAN] is the number of planes in the mesh (1 in 2D).
  \item [MARDAT and MARTIM] are two arrays of 3 integers containing the date :
    year, month, day, and hours, minutes, seconds.
  \item [I\_ORIG and J\_ORIG] are the numbers of metres to add to coordinates
    to get georeferenced data.
\end{description}

\subsection{Scientific library}

Some scientific functions have been included in \bief for convenience:

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
DOUBLE PRECISION FUNCTION ATANC(A,B)
\end{lstlisting}

ATANC returns the Arc tangent of A.

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
DOUBLE PRECISION FUNCTION JULTIM(YEAR,MONTH,DAY,HOUR,MIN,SEC,AT)
\end{lstlisting}

JULTIM returns the time in Julian centuries since the 31 December 1899. The
starting time of a computation is given by YEAR,MONTH,DAY,HOUR,MIN,SEC, and AT
(current time in the computation is added).

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
DOUBLE PRECISION FUNCTION TSLOC(YEAR,MONTH,DAY,HOUR,MIN,SEC,AT)
\end{lstlisting}

TSLOC returns the local sidereal time.

\subsection{Higher order subroutines in \bief}

A number of subroutines in \bief are more dedicated to physics and can be
directly called by programmes to solve e.g. diffusion or advection equations:

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE CVDFTR
\end{lstlisting}

In 2 dimensions, solves the advection-diffusion of a tracer, including source
terms. Starting from a tracer FN at time step n, it gives back the tracer F at
time step n+1. Refer to source code for a full list of arguments. The advection
may have been done previously by the method of characteristics, in which case
the result is in \telkey{FTILD}, or is done by \telkey{CVDFTR} itself, which
may call other subroutines such as \telkey{CVTRVF} and \telkey{CVTRVF\_POS}.
Explicit and implicit source terms may be treated, as well as punctual sources.
An argument \telkey{ICONVF} monitors the choice of the advection scheme.

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE CHARAC
\end{lstlisting}

This is the header subroutine for advection with the method of characteristics.
It calls scalar or parallel variants of this method. The parallel version of
the method of characteristics is included in module \telkey{STREAMLINE}.
\telkey{CHARAC} may deal with a single.

Refer to source code for a full list of arguments. FN is the variable to be
advected and FTILD the result. They may be blocks of variables and in this case
the argument NOMB is the number of variables that will be treated.

\subsection{User subroutines in \bief}

A number of subroutines are called by \bief and may be changed by the user to
implement specific cases. These subroutines have generally no arguments and
only global data defined in a module may thus be changed. Subroutines are
provided with examples.

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE CORLAT
\end{lstlisting}

CORLAT is called by INBIEF when the coordinates are spherical. It allows
changing of latitude and longitude of points.

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE CORRXY
\end{lstlisting}

CORRXY is called once at the beginning of INBIEF (and before CORLAT). It allows
to change the coordinates of points. Users are free to do any change (for
example translations or rotations) provided that it keeps the topology of the
mesh.

A translation in \telemac{2D} would be done by adding \telkey{USE
DECLARATIONS\_TELEMAC2D} in \telkey{CORRXY}, declaring integer I, and then:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
DO I=1,NPOIN
  X(I) = X(I) + 100.D0
  Y(I) = Y(I) + 200.D0
ENDDO
\end{lstlisting}

As a matter of fact, NPOIN, X and Y are pointers defined in
\telkey{DECLARATIONS\_TELEMAC2D}, to \telkey{MESH\%NPOIN}, \telkey{MESH\%X\%R}
 and \telkey{MESH\%Y\%R}

\underbar{syntax}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE STRCHE
\end{lstlisting}

\telkey{STRCHE} is called once after reading the bottom friction in the
geometry file, or after setting it to a constant value. This subroutine is
empty and can be used only with modules containing global declarations. We give
hereafter an example that would work with \telemac{2D}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SUBROUTINE STRCHE
  USE BIEF
  USE DECLARATIONS_TELEMAC2D
  INTEGER I
  DO I=1,NPOIN
    IF(X(I).GT.5.D0) THEN
      CHESTR%R(I) = 35.D0
    ELSE
      CHESTR%R(I) = 30.D0
    ENDIF
  ENDDO
  RETURN
END
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Designing a new programme}

\subsection{Global data}

Global data are defined by Fortran 90 modules. A number of other data are
gathered in a \bief module called \telkey{DECLARATIONS\_TELEMAC}. It is given
below:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
!
!  DECLARATIONS COMMON TO ALL PROGRAMMES      VERSION 6.1
!
      MODULE DECLARATIONS_TELEMAC
!

!
      CHARACTER(LEN=24) :: NNAMECODE(3)
!
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
!
      END MODULE DECLARATIONS\_TELEMAC
\end{lstlisting}

To use these values, it is only necessary to write:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
USE DECLARATIONS\_TELEMAC
\end{lstlisting}
as the first statement of every program or subroutine using them.

It is recommended to do a module of global declarations of your programme,
containing the data read in the parameter file, the BIEF\_OBJ structures, etc.
However this module must not be used in subroutines that would be called by
another programme in the Telemac system, which has no such declarations.

\subsection{General structure of a programme based on \bief 6.1}

\paragraph{Main program}

We give hereafter \textit{in extenso} the example of the main program of
\telemac{2D}, which exemplifies all complex cases: parameter estimation and
code coupling.

Some explanations:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The statement \telkey{USE BIEF} is given first because the module
    \telkey{DECLARATIONS\_TELEMAC2D} contains declarations of
    \telkey{BIEF\_OBJ} structures, for example the depth H or the mesh called
    \telkey{MESH}.
  \item The string CODE contains the name of the programme and will be used by
    \bief subroutines such as \telkey{BIEF\_OPEN\_FILES} to open the relevant
    files. It implies that the \telkey{LECDON\_TELEMAC2D} subroutine uses also
    the module \telkey{DECLARATIONS\_TELEMAC} and correctly fills the names of
    the files.
\end{itemize}

Other calls are explained in the following paragraphs.

\paragraph{Reading the parameter file}

This is done by the call to \telkey{LECDON\_TELEMAC2D}. Such a subroutine must
be written for every program in the system. LECDON\_TELEMAC2D calls the
subroutine \telkey{DAMOCLES} which returns the parameters read in the
dictionary file and in the user parameter file. We give hereafter parts of
\telkey{LECDON\_TELEMAC2D} as an example:

Remark: the names of the steering file and the dictionary, their logical units
are here hard-coded. As they are closed after, logical units 2 and 3 may be
re-used.

After calling \telkey{DAMOCLES}, the parameters are in the arrays MOTINT,
MOTREA, MOTLOG and MOTCAR if they are (respectively) integers, double precision
numbers, logical values or character strings. Their rank in the arrays is given
by their index in the dictionary.

\begin{itemize}
  \item ADRESS(1,*) is the addresses of integers in array MOTINT.
  \item ADRESS(2,*) is the addresses of double precision numbers in array
    MOTREA.
  \item ADRESS(3,*) is the addresses of logical values in array MOTLOG.
  \item ADRESS(4,*) is the addresses of strings in array MOTCAR.
\end{itemize}

For example the turbulence model is in \telemac{2D} an integer with rank 7 in
the dictionary. It is initialised as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
ITURB            = MOTINT( ADRESS(1, 7) )
\end{lstlisting}

The size of arrays is given by \telkey{DIMENS}, for example the array of
prescribed free surfaces (index 31 of double precision  numbers in the
dictionary) in \telemac{2D} is initialised by:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
NCOTE  = DIMENS(2,31)
IF(NCOTE.NE.0) THEN
  DO K=1,NCOTE
   COTE(K) = MOTREA( ADRESS(2,31) + K-1 )
  ENDDO
ENDIF
\end{lstlisting}

As MOTCAR is declared as an array of \telkey{CHARACTER(LEN=144)} strings, it
may be necessary to take only a part of them, as below:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
TITCAS    = MOTCAR( ADRESS(4, 1) )(1:72)
\end{lstlisting}

Where \telkey{TITCAS} is declared as a \telkey{CHARACTER(LEN=72)} string.

Checking and modifications of key-words should be done only in \telkey{LECDON}.

\paragraph{Allocating memory}

This is done in the subroutine called \telkey{POINT\_NAMEOFPROGRAMME}. We give
and comment hereafter parts of \telkey{POINT\_TELEMAC2D}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
      USE BIEF
      USE DECLARATIONS_TELEMAC
      USE DECLARATIONS_TELEMAC2D !where all BIEF_OBJ structures are declared

\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{The real main programme}

The main program \telkey{HOMERE\_...} given above calls \telkey{TELEMAC2D}.
This is where the real specific job of your programme must be done. At the
beginning of it, but after reading the boundary conditions file, the
\telkey{BIEF\_MESH} structure called MESH must be fully initialised, and this
is done by a call to \telkey{INBIEF}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
      CALL INBIEF(LIHBOR%I,KLOG,IT1,IT2,IT3,LVMAC,IELMX,
     &            LAMBD0,SPHERI,MESH,T1,T2,OPTASS,PRODUC,EQUA)
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Inputs and outputs: opening and closing files}

The various data and results files of every Telemac programme are described in
its dictionary. The information relevant to files will be read with the
subroutine \telkey{READ\_SUBMIT}, which is called in subroutine
\telkey{LECDON\_TELEMAC2D} (for example), and stored in an array of file
structures (called, depending of the Telemac module: \telkey{T2D\_FILES},
\telkey{T3D\_FILES}, \telkey{SIS\_FILES}, \telkey{WAC\_FILES},
\telkey{ART\_FILES}). Hereafter is given an excerpt of \telemac{2D} dictionary
regarding the results file:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelemacCas]
NOM = 'FICHIER DES RESULTATS'
NOM1 = 'RESULTS FILE'
TYPE = CARACTERE
INDEX = 11
MNEMO = `T2D\_FILES\%ADR(T2DRES)'
SUBMIT = 'T2DRES-READWRITE;T2DRES;OBLIG;BIN;ECR;SELAFIN'
DEFAUT = ' '
DEFAUT1 = ' '
\end{lstlisting}

The character string called SUBMIT is used both by the perl scripts and,
through Damocles, by the Fortran programme. It is composed of 6 character
strings.

The \textbf{first string}, here T2DRES-READWRITE, is made of:

\begin{enumerate}
\item  the Fortran integer for storing the file number: T2DRES (which is
  declared in declarations\_telemac2d.f)
\item  the argument ACTION in the Fortran Open statement that will be used to
  open the file. ACTION may be READ, WRITE, or READWRITE. Here it is READWRITE
  because the results file is written, and in case of validation it is read at
  the end of the computation. It will be stored into
  T2D\_FILES\%ADR(T2DRES)\%ACTION
\end{enumerate}

The \textbf{second string}, here T2DRES, is the name of the file as it will
appear in the temporary file where the computation is done.

The \textbf{third string} may be OBLIG (the name of the file must always be
given), or FACUL (this file is not mandatory).

The \textbf{fourth string} (here BIN) says if it is a binary (BIN) or ASCII
(ASC) file.

The \textbf{fifth string} is just like the READWRITE statement and is used by
the perl scripts.

The \textbf{sixth string} is also used by the perl scripts and gives
information on how the file must be treated. 'SELAFIN' means that the file is a
Selafin format, it will have to be decomposed if parallelism is used. Other
possibilities are:
\begin{description}
  \item [SELAFIN-GEOM] this is the geometry file
  \item [FORTRAN] this is the Fortran file for user subroutines
  \item [CAS] this is the parameter file
  \item [CONLIM] this is the boundary conditions file
  \item [PARAL] this file will have an extension added to its name, for
    distinguishing between processors
  \item [DICO] this is the dictionary
  \item [SCAL] this file will be the same for all processors
\end{description}
See Section \ref{ref:descDico} for a more detailed description of the SUBMIT
strings.

The following sequence of subroutines is used for opening, using and closing
files:

Note : subroutine INIT\_FILES2 in \bief version 5.9 has been renamed BIEF\_INIT
from version 6.0 on and has from now on nothing to see with files.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item{opening files}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
IFLOT=0
CALL BIEF_OPEN_FILES(CODE,T2D_FILES,44,PATH,NCAR,COUPLAGE,IFLOT,ICODE)
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{description}
  \item [CODE] name of calling program in 24 characters
  \item [T2D\_FILES] the array of BIEF\_FILE structures
  \item [44] the size of the previous array
  \item [PATH] full name of the path leading to the directory the case is
  \item [NCAR] number of characters of the string PATH
  \item [COUPLAGE] logical stating if there is a coupling between several programs.
  \item [IFLOT] in case of coupling, will be the last logical unit taken by a file
  \item [ICODE] code number in a coupling. For example in a coupling between
    \telemac{2D} and Sisyphe, \telemac{2D} will be code 1 and Sisyphe will be
    code 2.
\end{description}
\item using files

Most operations on files consist on reading and writing, which always uses the
logical unit. Every file has a name in the temporary folder where the program
is executed, e.g. T2DRES. The associated file number is an integer with the
same name. The logical unit of this file is stored into T2D\_FILES(T2DRES)\%LU.
The logical unit of the geometry file in Sisyphe will be
SIS\_FILES(SISGEO)\%LU.

Sometimes the real name of files in the original is also used, for example to
know if it exists (i.e. has been given in the parameter file). This name is
retrieved in the component NAME. For example the name of the geometry file in
Sisyphe will be SIS\_FILES(SISGEO)\%NAME. Note that the name of the same file
in the temporary folder is SIS\_FILES(SISGEO)\%TELNAME. We have in fact:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
SIS\_FILES(SISGEO)\%TELNAME='SISGEO'.
\end{lstlisting}

\item closing files

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TelFortran]
CALL BIEF\_CLOSE\_FILES(CODE,T2D\_FILES,44,PEXIT)
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{description}
  \item [CODE] name of calling program in 24 characters
  \item [T2D\_FILES] the array of BIEF\_FILE structures
  \item [44] the size of the previous array
  \item [PEXIT] logical, if yes will stop parallelism (in a coupling the last
    program calling \telkey{BIEF\_CLOSE\_FILES} will also stop parallelism).
\end{description}
\end{enumerate}
